1
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,365
You disappeared on me.
We had an appointment.

2
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:15,701
The mountains called.

3
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,663
{\an8}Sadie, it's normal
to be affected by what happened.

4
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,833
{\an8}Death, anyone's, can fill us with urgency.

5
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,710
This is not about what happened.

6
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,920
I didn't really know her, but…

7
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:29,965
She was the same as me.

8
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,884
Same age, same job.

9
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,554
The one time I was in her house,
it was the same as mine.

10
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,973
Nice, but cold.

11
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:43,812
Empty, except for one sad houseplant,
which is more than I have.

12
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:45,772
She died alone.

13
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:51,153
Sadie, stay present.
No big moves, no big changes.

14
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,574
So don't marry
the rafting guide I just met?

15
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,868
{\an8}Maybe start with a houseplant.

16
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,578
I'd probably eat it.

17
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,497
My cold, empty house has a cold,
empty fridge.

18
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,583
I'm gonna stop for groceries.

19
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,710
{\an8}-Let's check in tomorrow.
-Yeah.

20
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:14,551
No pesticides, more nutrients.
It just tastes better, you know.

21
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:17,888
Out of 20.

22
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,644
Sorry, guys.

23
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,116
Five, six, seven. Have a good one.

24
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:42,538
You know you're gonna need
to buy stock in those trackers.

25
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:44,706
You'd lose your butt
if it wasn't attached to you.

26
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,334
Well, you lost your hair,
and that was attached.

27
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:49,670
I walked into that one.

28
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,047
Hey, Cole. Are you okay?

29
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,509
Yeah, heard you got dumped.
Tough break, man.

30
00:02:57,261 --> 00:03:00,305
-Edna.
-I gossip when I'm bored.

31
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,349
For your information, it was mutual.

32
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,226
That's what everyone says
after getting dumped.

33
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,394
That's true.

34
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,521
Maybe try being a little less needy,
you know?

35
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,022
Girls don't really like that.

36
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,232
I'm not needy.

37
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,986
We just grew apart.

38
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,029
And I really just don't wanna talk
about it.

39
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,450
You wanna go get high?

40
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,871
I got a edible in the truck.

41
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:26,957
No, thanks.

42
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,334
Okay. Well, watch my booth.
I'm gonna go get high.

43
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,087
Enjoy.

44
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,799
-Come on. Here.
-Uh, just that one.

45
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:39,344
-Just this one.
-I'll take one too.

46
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,351
Salmon. Halibut. It's all fresh.

47
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,489
Can I help you?

48
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:05,454
Yes, thank you. I'm gonna get that one.

49
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:09,124
Begonia. Nice choice.

50
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,335
-Is that what it is?
-Yeah.

51
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,505
It is pretty.

52
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,589
Yeah.

53
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:23,222
Don't let any pets eat the leaves.
They can be slightly toxic.

54
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,558
Pretty and slightly toxic.

55
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,645
What is it with me and roommates?

56
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,813
Didn't realize you roomed
with all of my exes.

57
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,572
How much watering does it need?

58
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,535
Every other day or so.
Begonias need a little bit of love.

59
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,374
I'm actually gone a lot for work.

60
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,459
Okay.

61
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:55,045
Okay, got it. Less love.

62
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:57,422
What about a snake plant?

63
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,008
They only need watering every two weeks.

64
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:06,014
Sometimes I'm gone longer,
like a month or two.

65
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,058
Okay.

66
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:12,104
Sorry, then why do you want a plant
if you're never home?

67
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,189
I'm not never home. I just--

68
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:19,027
How about if you find me
something a little less needy?

69
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:25,033
Right. Why not just get a plastic plant?

70
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:26,285
That's sad.

71
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,911
Well, not as sad as killing a plant.

72
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,415
And some of the new ones,
they look totally real.

73
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,834
No amount of neglect will kill them.

74
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,335
Neglect?

75
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,338
You know what, I'm gonna get this one.

76
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,966
-Yep.
-Thank you.

77
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:49,683
Sorry, I can't sell you this plant.

78
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,102
I can't sell it to you in good conscience.

79
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:55,939
Good conscience?
What are you, the patron saint of plants?

80
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,400
I just don't feel comfortable
selling a plant to someone

81
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,568
that can be so indifferent

82
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:00,986
-towards a living thing.
-Indifferent?

83
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,988
Is this how you speak
to all your customers?

84
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,115
'Cause if you do,
I'm shocked that you sell anything at all.

85
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,159
No, as a matter of fact,
this isn't even my stall.

86
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,577
I just don't wanna be an accomplice…

87
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,704
You're refusing to sell me a plant
that you don't even own?

88
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,914
-That's right.
-Hey, Cole.

89
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,957
-What's going on?
-Hi.

90
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,918
-Are these your plants?
-Yes.

91
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,420
Awesome. 'Cause Farmer Clown here
won't sell me one.

92
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:21,048
-Farmer Clown. That's funny.
-The plant is $10, honey.

93
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,841
Edna, sh--

94
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:26,386
All right, you know what?
Hey, want a plant? Here. Cactus.

95
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,139
Requires the bare minimum love
a human can give,

96
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,974
so you'll totally kill it.

97
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,021
You should fire him.

98
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,024
-She's just gonna…
-Have a good one.

99
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,526
RIP, little guy.

100
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:43,529
-Can you believe that?
-No.

101
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,114
I thought for sure you two
were gonna exchange numbers.

102
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:47,824
-What?
-Yes.

103
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,577
I thought, under all that stupid fighting,
you were flirting.

104
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,871
-Wait, we were flirting?
-Are you kidding me?

105
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:57,084
Are you high?
The sexual tension was off the charts.

106
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:02,673
Edna, watch my stall.

107
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:05,384
Hey, hey, hey, sorr--

108
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,886
-Sorry. Sorry, sorry.
-Shit.

109
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:13,892
Hi. Hi. Yep, it's me.

110
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:15,519
Sorry. Just…

111
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:19,940
Are you here to rescue the plant?

112
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,276
No. No, I'm not. That's funny.

113
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,152
No, I was just--

114
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,738
Well, I was just wondering
if you wanted to,

115
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,158
you know, go out sometime.

116
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,871
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

117
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:35,706
Yeah, I mean, I--

118
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,625
I mean, I know we were kind of…

119
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,294
arguing back there,

120
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:43,797
but I thought that underneath it,
there was…

121
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:46,842
something.

122
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,636
Something?

123
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,513
Yeah.

124
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,349
I'm wrong, aren't I?

125
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,686
Well, this is embarrassing.

126
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:04,109
Sorry, sorry. I misread it.

127
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:18,207
I can use a coffee.

128
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:22,377
A coffee?
You want to get a-- Yeah. Like, now?

129
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,505
Yes, now.

130
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:27,424
Get in.

131
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,593
Yeah, well-- Yeah. Yeah.

132
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,350
-I'm Cole, by the way.
-Seat belt.

133
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,184
Yep, yep, yep. Sorry.

134
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:41,897
I'll just hang on.

135
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,025
Okay.

136
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,831
I like the canal.
It reminds me of Amsterdam.

137
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,626
So, art curators travel a lot?

138
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,379
Oh, yeah. All over the world.

139
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:08,924
I love it.

140
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:12,177
Just jumping on a plane, moment's notice,

141
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:15,681
and then, you know,
stepping out into a new place.

142
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:18,225
Wow.

143
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,187
Oh, gosh,
don't tell me you're one of those big,

144
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,898
tough guys who's afraid
to leave the country.

145
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:27,568
Okay, first of all,
thank you for calling me big and tough.

146
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:31,071
Let's keep that going.
And I travel. I travel a lot.

147
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:33,949
-Really?
-Yeah.

148
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,243
Yeah, I think the trips
that you plan the least

149
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,995
are the ones that give you the most.

150
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,457
I agree.

151
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,838
Lincoln got shot just across
the street, and he died right next door.

152
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,882
Sounds like you're a big fan of Lincoln.

153
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,217
Well, history in general.

154
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:55,012
I majored in agriculture,
but I minored in history.

155
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,221
That's my real passion.

156
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:58,640
You know, I'm writing a book.

157
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,310
-You are?
-Yeah.

158
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,354
History of farming?

159
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:08,317
No, it's about the rise
and fall of different empires

160
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,527
and the critical role that agriculture--

161
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,529
Yeah, it's about farming.

162
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:15,490
So how's it going?

163
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:18,952
Well, it's on pause for now.

164
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:22,664
My dad got hurt a few years ago,
so I came back to help him with the farm.

165
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:24,875
So not a lot of time for writing.

166
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,211
I'm sorry.

167
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,588
It's okay. I'll finish it.

168
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:34,510
You've never seen The Exorcist?
It's a classic.

169
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:38,388
It's one of the scariest movies ever made,
and they filmed it right here.

170
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,265
I don't know.
I don't get scared by movies.

171
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:42,935
Yeah,
because you haven't seen The Exorcist.

172
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:45,437
No, 'cause you can choose
not being scared.

173
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:49,066
Okay. Little bet. Race me to the top.

174
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,486
And if I beat you,
you gotta tell me what scares you.

175
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:56,907
-I love this.
-All right. I like the confidence.

176
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,743
Hang on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Let me just-- Hang on.

177
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:04,248
Come on. Put all that in here.

178
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:08,168
Are you gonna carry all my stuff?
Okay. Wait, wait, wait.

179
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:10,963
You looking for pity?

180
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,048
That's exactly what I'm looking for.

181
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,093
Oh, my friend.

182
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,887
-You ready?
-Yeah.

183
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:21,014
And go!

184
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,121
You know, I'm guessing you work out.

185
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:46,456
Are you okay?

186
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,083
Oh, yeah.

187
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,633
Oh, my God. I love Monet.

188
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,064
So you can just choose not
to be scared, huh?

189
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:16,945
When I was six,

190
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:19,823
my mom and I fled our country…

191
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:22,409
on a raft.

192
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,495
Oh, my God. That must have been--

193
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:27,247
Worse than you can imagine.

194
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:33,921
The sun, the waves,
sharks, people screaming, crying.

195
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,632
I was terrified. Everyone was.

196
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:41,178
They wanted to go back,
but my mom was so strong.

197
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,933
She kept us all going for five days,

198
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:48,977
until we made it.

199
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:54,024
And I still remember how they looked
at her on the beach.

200
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:59,363
I just, you know, wanted to be like her,

201
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,532
strong and brave.

202
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:07,371
So that's the day I decided I was never
going to be afraid ever again.

203
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:10,707
And I'm not.

204
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:16,630
I believe you.

205
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:21,385
But it is very cute that you're scared
of this movie with the little girl.

206
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:24,680
-Oh, my God. This is my own fault.
-That's-- What's the name again?

207
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:26,306
-It's The Exorcist.
-I have to watch it now.

208
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,101
One of the scariest movies of all time.
You're gonna have nightmares for a month.

209
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:30,185
-Wow.
-Just watch.

210
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:36,859
This has just been incredible.

211
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,110
It was great.

212
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,904
And not to be too forward,

213
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:44,324
but if you ever felt
like getting a drink sometime…

214
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:45,409
How about now?

215
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,036
Okay.

216
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,330
I know a great place.

217
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:01,466
Hey!

218
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:10,684
Thank you.

219
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:13,187
You are amazing.

220
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,230
How do you make that look cool?

221
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:17,316
That's rockaoke. No dignity here.

222
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,236
And next up, we have Cole Turner,
turnin' up the heat

223
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:24,239
-with "20th Century Boy."
-What happened?

224
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:28,285
-No, no, no, no, no. No, no.
-I might have put your name down.

225
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,912
-Come on, Cole.
-Sadie. Sadie.

226
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:32,039
Sadie,
I get nervous singing in the shower.

227
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:33,540
-Just give it a go.
-I'm not a performer.

228
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:35,792
-Cole! Cole! Cole!
-Cole Turner.

229
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:38,086
-Where is Cole Turner?
-Please.

230
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,463
I can't.

231
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:42,674
He's not gonna do it.
Just call someone else.

232
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:45,135
Give me the mic.

233
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:49,765
Thank you.

234
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:08,951
Now, you're out there,
seeing the world, traveling,

235
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:13,705
meeting interesting people.
It's quite a life.

236
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,167
Lately, I'm not so sure.

237
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:22,631
Someone I know just died. A coworker.

238
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,093
It got me thinking.

239
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:30,556
You know, there are all
these things you want in life…

240
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:34,977
and it's so hard to find someone who--

241
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:41,692
If only people
could be more like your cactus.

242
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,569
Not needing watering all the time?

243
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:46,154
Right. Exactly.

244
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:48,991
-Just living their own lives.
-Yeah.

245
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:51,660
Not needing someone else,
like, nourishing them.

246
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:53,537
That makes sense.

247
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:34,912
Morning.

248
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:38,081
-What?
-Nothing.

249
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,461
Good night then.

250
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:43,795
I mean, good morning.

251
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:45,380
This was quite a date.

252
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:46,882
You mean a day?

253
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:51,178
Right. Yeah, that's-- Officially.
That's a first.

254
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:52,930
Yeah, me too.

255
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,937
Well, goodbye.

256
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:02,731
Goodbye.

257
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:25,045
Well, I look forward to our next day.

258
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,093
-Bye.

259
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,235
Be a cactus.

260
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:52,739
No big moves. No big moves.

261
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:54,700
Be a cactus.

262
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:35,157
Wow.

263
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:38,994
First farmer?

264
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:43,498
Yeah.

265
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:46,919
You know that power you felt?
That's from the land.

266
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:17,407
Hey, Coleslaw.

267
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:18,575
Hey, Dad.

268
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:20,744
Thanks for closing up the stand
for me last night.

269
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,372
Not a problem.
Edna gave me a hand. She was high.

270
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:26,041
Look who's finally home.

271
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,501
God, take it easy, Mom.

272
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,336
He just got back
from having sex with a stranger,

273
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:30,879
not fighting the Germans.

274
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:34,466
Okay, now, come on. Spill the beans.

275
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:38,262
Well, her name is Sadie, and she is…

276
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:43,225
She's incredible.
I mean, I know this sounds a little crazy,

277
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:47,145
but I think she might be the one.

278
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:49,857
Really? Well, that's fast.

279
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,900
Well, I can't wait to meet her.

280
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:54,278
Did you tell her you wrestled
in high school?

281
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:56,822
-No.
-What is this?

282
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:59,658
You took a selfie
in bed while she was asleep?

283
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:00,951
Dude, that's weird.

284
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:03,745
That's what serial killers do
before they kill their victims

285
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:04,955
and harvest their eyelids.

286
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,374
I was happy.
I wanted to preserve the moment.

287
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:10,377
-He is doing it again.
-Doing what?

288
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,755
It's just-- Cole, you can get a bit--

289
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:14,965
Smothering, needy, pathetic,

290
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:16,300
-desperate, delusional.
-What?

291
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:19,678
Yeah, stuff like this.
The stupid gifts, the constant texting.

292
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:21,889
I mean, that's why things never
worked out with Fiona.

293
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:23,182
Fiona was a bitch.

294
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:26,101
You're a hopeless romantic,
just like your mom.

295
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:27,811
Tell her you wrestled in high school.

296
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:31,023
Look, I'm not needy,
and I'm not smothering.

297
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:34,693
And for your information,
I've sent Sadie one text today. One.

298
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:40,657
Three. And some light emoji stuff,
but that doesn't count.

299
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:41,992
Emoji stuff counts.

300
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:45,037
He is gonna blow it. Mark my words.

301
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,121
I'm not gonna bl--

302
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:48,832
She really is great.

303
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:51,418
You'll see.

304
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:19,446
Hey. Head in the game, Coleslaw.
Come on. A lot of honey to harvest.

305
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:34,920
You need some slack?

306
00:21:35,546 --> 00:21:39,341
We're good. Hang on.
Just gotta hook it in. One sec.

307
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:46,682
Should I get it? I can get it.
It's right here. So easy for me.

308
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:50,352
Hello?

309
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:56,817
Good news.

310
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,236
Mortgage refinancing rates
have never been lower.

311
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:13,917
Any word?

312
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:18,672
Maybe your phone's broken.

313
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:20,340
Yeah, maybe you should do a hard reset.

314
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:22,718
There's nothing wrong with my phone.

315
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:24,928
No, no, no, I meant with your life.

316
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:27,556
You know, grow a pair,
move out of your parents' house.

317
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:28,682
Guesthouse.

318
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:32,311
Well, I'm sure
there's a logical reason for it.

319
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:33,687
There is.

320
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,065
He came off way too strong,
so she ghosted him.

321
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:38,150
Ghosted?

322
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:40,694
Yeah.
It's when someone breaks off all contact.

323
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:43,780
For example, let's just say a young lady
makes a horrible,

324
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:45,199
horrible mistake one night,

325
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:48,785
and then the guy just keeps
on texting her with emojis,

326
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:50,495
over and over.

327
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:52,539
She did not ghost me, okay?

328
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,709
-She did.
-You wanna pick this up?

329
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:56,919
No.

330
00:22:57,002 --> 00:23:00,714
Hey, pal, you're huffing and puffing.
Why don't you take a hit off your scuba?

331
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,592
Come on, hey. Let's go.

332
00:23:07,513 --> 00:23:08,597
Oh, my God.

333
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:13,685
Sorry. You did the leave-behind
with your inhaler?

334
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:16,396
Come on.
Isn't your asthma sad enough already?

335
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,649
It wasn't a leave-behind.
I forgot it in her purse.

336
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:22,694
And it has one of those tiles on it.
Those tracking things that I use.

337
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:26,657
All right. Drumroll, please.

338
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,201
The woman of my dreams is in…

339
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:32,371
-London.
-England?

340
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:35,499
-London, the Lady in the Mist.
-No one calls it that.

341
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:38,001
-The Gray Lady.
-No, that's New York Times.

342
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:40,254
-Are ya sure?
-Yes.

343
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:41,755
She does travel a lot for work.

344
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:43,590
Well, there you go. That makes sense.

345
00:23:43,674 --> 00:23:46,593
She probably got called away last minute
on this job and had to rush over there.

346
00:23:46,677 --> 00:23:49,388
You know,
international calling plans and whatnot.

347
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:51,348
I bet she hasn't even seen your texts.

348
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:53,684
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Okay.

349
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:55,686
-Exactly.
-Okay, so this is fine?

350
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:57,187
-Absolutely.
-Yeah.

351
00:23:57,271 --> 00:24:00,190
Cole, you should go over there.

352
00:24:00,274 --> 00:24:03,318
-What?
-Yeah, show up and surprise her.

353
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:06,530
It'd be a romantic gesture,
something we can tell our grandchildren.

354
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:10,033
Mom, you can't be serious.
Cole, going to London? No.

355
00:24:10,117 --> 00:24:12,286
Why not? This is a perfect opportunity

356
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:15,998
to get out there
and grab life by the horns.

357
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:17,249
She's gonna think you're psycho.

358
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:20,460
Or she'll think that I'm the kind of guy

359
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:22,546
that's willing to jump
on a plane at a moment's notice.

360
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:25,132
Wait, but you're not that kind of guy.
You do not travel anywhere.

361
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:27,217
-You haven't even left the country.
-That's not true.

362
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:28,886
He was conceived in Ontario.

363
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:30,429
Cole, you can do this.

364
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:32,264
Yeah, but what about the farm?
There's so much to do.

365
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:35,434
-I can't just leave you here.
-Coleslaw, don't worry about the farm.

366
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:37,936
-Yeah.
-By the horns. Come on.

367
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,229
Yeah, go to her.

368
00:24:41,315 --> 00:24:42,316
You know what I have?

369
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:45,027
You remember that spring break
where I was supposed to go to Spain

370
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,820
and I gave up my seat and I got a voucher?

371
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:48,697
That is my point exactly, Cole.

372
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,284
You missed spring break
to get a stupid voucher,

373
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:54,411
which you never used.

374
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:56,663
I mean, that is the type of guy you are.

375
00:24:56,747 --> 00:24:57,789
Not today.

376
00:24:57,873 --> 00:25:01,376
-You still have--
-I've got goose bumps.

377
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:03,003
Thanks for the warning.

378
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:04,588
I'm going to London.

379
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:17,559
{\an8}So it's not like a weird stalker thing.
It's just a grand romantic gesture.

380
00:25:17,643 --> 00:25:20,938
Yeah, that is amazing, mate.
I mean, I admire your confidence.

381
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:24,858
5,000 miles to surprise a girl
who you've only met once.

382
00:25:24,942 --> 00:25:26,818
I mean,
that is the epitome of romance, mate.

383
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:28,570
Yeah, exactly. See, you get it.

384
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:30,864
Especially if she's the one
who ghosted you.

385
00:25:30,948 --> 00:25:33,575
I was-- Wait, what?
No, no, she didn't ghost me.

386
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:35,619
She just doesn't
have an international calling plan.

387
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:37,412
Right.

388
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:41,416
An international art curator,
doesn't have an overseas calling plan.

389
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,626
That's very unusual.

390
00:25:44,253 --> 00:25:45,587
Talking of romantic gestures,

391
00:25:45,671 --> 00:25:47,464
what's that you got in the back then, hey?

392
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:49,508
-Is it a little cactus, is it?
-Yeah.

393
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:53,428
Yeah, this is a little inside joke
between us.

394
00:25:53,512 --> 00:25:56,557
Little cactus.
I'm sure she'll split her sides laughing.

395
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:04,648
Right, we are nearly here. Tower Bridge.

396
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:12,197
That'll be 137 quid, please.

397
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:16,326
-That's kind of a lot, isn't it?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's outrageous.

398
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:19,079
You never get a cab from the airport
to the center of London.

399
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:22,666
It'll cost you a small fortune, mate.
Yeah. Toodle-pip.

400
00:26:33,844 --> 00:26:36,180
Take care, now. Thanks very much.

401
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:41,518
Have a good evening. Have a good night.

402
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:12,818
Let me tell you how
this will be. One for you, 19 for me.

403
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:16,029
'Cause I'm the taxman.

404
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,865
Listen to me.

405
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:21,493
I can't believe I'm quoting
"The Taxman" to you.

406
00:28:21,577 --> 00:28:25,706
So lame. I really am turning into my dad.

407
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:27,207
It's true what they say.

408
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:31,378
When you meet a celebrity,
your IQ drops 50 points.

409
00:28:32,171 --> 00:28:34,798
-Where am I?
-It's just-- You're a living legend.

410
00:28:34,882 --> 00:28:37,509
Stopping our shipment in Turkey,

411
00:28:37,593 --> 00:28:39,261
the assassination in Berlin

412
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:42,890
and now this thing with Elena
and the passcode.

413
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:47,895
The boss talks about you all the time.
You've become an obsession for him.

414
00:28:47,978 --> 00:28:52,024
"The Taxman killed Elena.
The Taxman has the passcode.

415
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:55,819
Oh, how I want to find
and murder the Taxman."

416
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:57,738
And now here you are.

417
00:28:57,821 --> 00:29:00,365
No, no, I'm not a taxman. I'm a farmer.

418
00:29:00,449 --> 00:29:05,412
I came to London to surprise a girl,
and these guys, they jumped me.

419
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:06,788
Textbook evasion.

420
00:29:06,872 --> 00:29:10,501
Frankly, a little disappointing,
but the performance?

421
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:11,710
Sublime.

422
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:13,879
It's like you truly believe
what you're saying.

423
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:15,255
Because I'm telling the truth.

424
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:17,466
You have the wrong guy.
My name is Cole Turner.

425
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:19,760
My passport's right over there in the bag,
in the front flap.

426
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:24,515
Sublime.
It truly is an honor to torture you today.

427
00:29:25,224 --> 00:29:27,684
Okay, just wait. Wait.

428
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:31,063
-Normally, I begin with the punching.
-Wait a minute.

429
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:36,360
You see, it causes me a little pain too.

430
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:39,613
I'm all about sharing the experience.

431
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:42,199
My therapist says that I'm an empath,

432
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:46,036
which means that I'm deeply attuned
to others' feelings.

433
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:52,543
But alas, the boss is in a real tizzy
about the passcode.

434
00:29:54,378 --> 00:29:58,465
Are you familiar
with the Schmidt sting pain index?

435
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:01,093
Wait, the what? Wait a minute.

436
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:06,515
It's a rating system for the pain
caused by the bites and stings of insects.

437
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:10,561
From the simple ouch
of the western honeybee

438
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:15,274
to the spray-and-pray
of the Latin American bullet ant

439
00:30:16,108 --> 00:30:19,570
that you can see primed
and ready in that box on the table.

440
00:30:20,237 --> 00:30:23,198
Spray-and-pray is short
for "spray in your pants

441
00:30:23,991 --> 00:30:27,160
and pray for the merciful release
of death."

442
00:30:27,244 --> 00:30:28,453
Excuse me, sir,

443
00:30:29,371 --> 00:30:31,248
will you just grab that bag
for me quickly?

444
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:33,375
I promise,
this is just a big misunderstanding--

445
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:37,713
Normally, we like to start slow
and build our way up.

446
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:40,382
But you are special,

447
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:46,597
so we begin with the murder hornet.

448
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:49,600
Shit. Shit.

449
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:54,229
Unless, of course,
you want to reveal the passcode.

450
00:30:54,313 --> 00:30:57,024
I don't know any passcode!
I'm telling you, you have the wrong guy.

451
00:30:57,107 --> 00:30:58,150
My name is Cole Turner.

452
00:30:58,233 --> 00:31:00,068
Just look at the passport.
It's right there in the bag.

453
00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:03,655
That's just great.
This is going to be fun.

454
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:07,159
For me, not for you.

455
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:09,912
Holy shit. Holy shit. Wait, wait--

456
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:12,247
God. Shit! Shit!

457
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:20,380
You.

458
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:28,847
Can you walk?

459
00:31:28,931 --> 00:31:31,475
-What?
-Can you walk, Cole?

460
00:31:33,018 --> 00:31:33,936
Sadie.

461
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:41,944
Head down, mouth closed.
Follow me before anyone sounds the alarm.

462
00:31:44,655 --> 00:31:48,158
-Know how to use a gun?
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah. But--

463
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:52,788
Shoot anyone who's not me.
Stay on my six. Let's go.

464
00:31:56,792 --> 00:31:58,544
Sadie. Geez.

465
00:31:59,837 --> 00:32:02,381
Sadie, what the hell is going on?
Who are these people?

466
00:32:02,464 --> 00:32:04,132
Bad guys.

467
00:32:04,216 --> 00:32:06,885
They set a trap for one of our agents,
and you fell into it.

468
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:09,304
Agents. Art agents?

469
00:32:09,388 --> 00:32:11,098
-Over here.
-Down!

470
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:16,228
Not an art agent. Got it.

471
00:32:18,355 --> 00:32:21,608
Sorry, there's a lot going on.
Plus those guys drugged me.

472
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:24,695
Who are you?

473
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:28,240
CIA. At least,
until they find out about this fiasco.

474
00:32:29,157 --> 00:32:30,576
Keep moving.

475
00:32:32,703 --> 00:32:34,788
My God, you're a spy!

476
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:38,792
Do you actually know where you're going?

477
00:32:42,087 --> 00:32:43,380
Get down!

478
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:47,676
Behind you!

479
00:32:52,556 --> 00:32:53,473
You hurt?

480
00:32:54,516 --> 00:32:58,145
No, it's the most amazing thing I've--

481
00:32:59,605 --> 00:33:02,900
I'm so confused.
They kept asking me about the Taxman.

482
00:33:02,983 --> 00:33:06,403
-They asked you about the Taxman?
-No, they think I am a Taxman.

483
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:08,530
They think you're the Taxman?

484
00:33:08,614 --> 00:33:10,866
That the Taxman would actually fall
for that lazy trap?

485
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:13,202
They caught the Taxman, and it's you?

486
00:33:17,998 --> 00:33:19,625
-You're the Taxman!
-Oh, my God.

487
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:21,335
Oh, my God!

488
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:23,545
All right. Check down here.

489
00:33:26,215 --> 00:33:27,299
Freeze!

490
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:40,479
Shoot him!

491
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:42,689
-Hey, hey!
-Shoot him!

492
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:44,191
Just stick 'em up.

493
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:51,615
You said you could shoot!

494
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:53,492
At tin cans, not people.

495
00:33:56,245 --> 00:33:57,704
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

496
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:01,917
Here.

497
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:04,002
There! Go!

498
00:34:06,922 --> 00:34:08,130
-Move! Move!
-Where they at?

499
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:13,053
Art curator, my ass.

500
00:34:13,136 --> 00:34:17,224
I thought you were different too.
Sweet, fun, low-maintenance.

501
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:19,810
I can't believe I was gonna call you
when I got back.

502
00:34:22,437 --> 00:34:23,856
Cover me.

503
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:39,913
Cole.

504
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,045
Were you really gonna call me
when you got back?

505
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:52,759
Yes, until you texted me 11 times
in two days.

506
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:56,388
-Seven. Emoji stuff doesn't count.
-Yes, it does.

507
00:34:57,014 --> 00:34:59,308
Emoji stuff counts. Move.

508
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:26,335
-Come on.
-Where the hell are we?

509
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:44,770
Jump! Cole, come on!

510
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:52,694
-I swallowed a rock.
-Keep going!

511
00:36:11,296 --> 00:36:12,339
Cover me.

512
00:36:20,556 --> 00:36:21,557
Stop!

513
00:36:22,683 --> 00:36:23,642
Get off the bus.

514
00:36:37,072 --> 00:36:38,198
Come on!

515
00:36:45,622 --> 00:36:47,875
-You're never gonna make it through.
-We're not going that way.

516
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:59,136
Do you know what you're doing?
Have you done this before?

517
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:00,637
I'm gonna let you think yes.

518
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,292
I cannot believe you got me kidnapped
and tortured all after one date.

519
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:32,085
You're the one who flew to London.

520
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:44,848
Holy shit!

521
00:37:50,938 --> 00:37:52,689
-You are unbelievable!
-What?

522
00:37:52,773 --> 00:37:55,484
You stalkered your way across the ocean
to find me.

523
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:57,653
That is not cactus behavior!

524
00:38:00,364 --> 00:38:01,949
Don't use stalker as a verb.

525
00:38:02,574 --> 00:38:04,409
And it was a romantic gesture!

526
00:38:10,332 --> 00:38:11,875
I checked your records.

527
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:13,377
You've never even left the country.

528
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,881
You checked my records?
Who's stalkering now?

529
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:54,728
Sadie!

530
00:40:24,007 --> 00:40:25,717
Look out!

531
00:40:33,267 --> 00:40:35,644
-Choke him out.
-They usually tap.

532
00:40:35,727 --> 00:40:38,522
He's not going to tap. Just choke him out.

533
00:41:23,817 --> 00:41:25,819
Cole! Are you comfortable?

534
00:41:25,903 --> 00:41:26,904
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

535
00:42:15,244 --> 00:42:16,537
Is that what I think it is?

536
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,163
It was meant to be a joke.

537
00:42:19,206 --> 00:42:21,875
It was a lot funnier
before I used it to kill a man.

538
00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:28,090
Hey.

539
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,801
Time to walk.

540
00:42:36,932 --> 00:42:38,016
Great khans,

541
00:42:39,142 --> 00:42:40,978
they used to cross these lands.

542
00:42:42,145 --> 00:42:43,230
Brutal killers.

543
00:42:47,025 --> 00:42:50,195
It was said if you wanted to find one,

544
00:42:51,989 --> 00:42:53,448
you had to step over the dead.

545
00:42:53,949 --> 00:42:58,537
The Taxman has a face.
No matches in the intelligence databases.

546
00:42:59,621 --> 00:43:00,998
They must be running him off the books.

547
00:43:02,457 --> 00:43:03,458
Clever.

548
00:43:04,626 --> 00:43:06,920
I've got blood on my hands.

549
00:43:07,004 --> 00:43:10,340
It's the blood of bad men.
We did what we had to.

550
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,093
Is that what you tell yourself?

551
00:43:13,177 --> 00:43:14,386
You're a liar.

552
00:43:15,554 --> 00:43:17,139
I'm not the liar here.

553
00:43:18,348 --> 00:43:20,809
I told you things I've never told anyone.

554
00:43:21,643 --> 00:43:22,936
It was all true.

555
00:43:24,271 --> 00:43:25,522
Not all of it!

556
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:31,737
Okay, one lie about my job.

557
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:35,324
I really ate it up too, didn't I?

558
00:43:35,407 --> 00:43:37,993
Especially that sob story
about your coworker that died.

559
00:43:38,076 --> 00:43:39,203
That is low.

560
00:43:40,078 --> 00:43:43,165
That was actually true.
Her name was Elena.

561
00:43:43,248 --> 00:43:44,958
And she really died?

562
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:49,505
I may have killed her.

563
00:43:50,547 --> 00:43:51,590
What?

564
00:43:52,841 --> 00:43:54,635
She was an enemy agent.

565
00:43:55,385 --> 00:43:56,595
She worked for these guys.

566
00:43:56,678 --> 00:43:58,180
You said she was a coworker.

567
00:43:58,263 --> 00:43:59,806
She was. In a loose sense.

568
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:01,767
See, this is what I'm talking about.

569
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:05,229
-It's just lies and lies and more lies.
-It's not lies and more lies.

570
00:44:05,312 --> 00:44:07,439
It's the sub-lie
of the first original lie.

571
00:44:07,523 --> 00:44:09,858
-You're unbelievable.
-Hey.

572
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:12,694
Fine, I lied about my job.

573
00:44:12,778 --> 00:44:14,446
But you lied about who you are.

574
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:16,823
Well, excuse me for fudging a few details

575
00:44:16,907 --> 00:44:19,660
to try and impress
the most amazing woman I've ever met.

576
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,623
-Please.
-Who apparently kills coworkers.

577
00:44:24,706 --> 00:44:27,709
Oh, my God!
She killed innocent people, Cole!

578
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:31,964
Do you know what? I am done with you.

579
00:44:32,714 --> 00:44:35,425
Head down, shut your mouth
and follow my lead.

580
00:44:36,176 --> 00:44:39,179
The sooner I get rid of you,
the sooner I get back to the mission.

581
00:44:39,263 --> 00:44:40,347
Fine. You know what?

582
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:43,767
I just want to get away from you
and out of here as fast as possible.

583
00:44:43,851 --> 00:44:44,685
You should.

584
00:44:44,768 --> 00:44:48,355
'Cause I've tangled with these guys
before, and they are ruthless.

585
00:44:48,438 --> 00:44:52,609
And now they think you're me,
so they're looking for you, Taxman.

586
00:45:02,411 --> 00:45:05,998
I'll speak with Utami. Buy us some time.

587
00:45:15,465 --> 00:45:17,384
And the passcode?

588
00:45:17,467 --> 00:45:20,137
Looks like Borislov was too slow.

589
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,221
As usual.

590
00:45:22,931 --> 00:45:25,392
But I finally know
what the Taxman looks like,

591
00:45:25,475 --> 00:45:26,476
so I'll find him.

592
00:45:29,313 --> 00:45:30,689
What is this?

593
00:45:32,316 --> 00:45:33,817
He doesn't know anything.

594
00:45:38,155 --> 00:45:42,034
We cannot afford this kind of failure.

595
00:45:46,163 --> 00:45:49,458
The game we play, it's like no other.

596
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:56,256
If we succeed,

597
00:45:57,299 --> 00:46:00,260
we have wealth, power.

598
00:46:02,095 --> 00:46:05,474
And if we fail, we die.

599
00:46:05,557 --> 00:46:07,851
And that is only if we're lucky.

600
00:46:07,935 --> 00:46:08,977
No, please.

601
00:46:10,562 --> 00:46:13,065
-Please help me.
-No more mistakes.

602
00:46:13,857 --> 00:46:14,858
No.

603
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:27,788
Get that photo to every bounty hunter
on the continent.

604
00:46:28,455 --> 00:46:30,332
One million dollars. Alive.

605
00:46:30,415 --> 00:46:32,709
He is our only access to that code.

606
00:46:32,793 --> 00:46:37,422
Anyone kills the Taxman,
that bounty moves onto their head.

607
00:47:11,456 --> 00:47:12,457
Be right back.

608
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:57,794
Just like your farmers' market.

609
00:47:59,379 --> 00:48:00,380
Come on.

610
00:48:04,218 --> 00:48:05,427
Where are you taking me?

611
00:48:06,094 --> 00:48:08,764
Back to your farm,
unless you screw this up.

612
00:48:11,016 --> 00:48:12,017
Stay close.

613
00:48:26,198 --> 00:48:27,199
Be cool.

614
00:48:46,093 --> 00:48:47,094
How you doing?

615
00:48:50,305 --> 00:48:52,349
What? Friendly isn't cool?

616
00:48:53,016 --> 00:48:56,520
Well, well, well, Sadie sunflower.

617
00:48:56,603 --> 00:48:58,480
-Marco.
-Look at you.

618
00:49:04,111 --> 00:49:05,279
Who's your friend?

619
00:49:05,988 --> 00:49:09,157
-I'm--
-He's a civilian I just recovered.

620
00:49:11,785 --> 00:49:13,954
You look ravenous, mate.

621
00:49:14,037 --> 00:49:16,874
Let me put something inside you.

622
00:49:16,957 --> 00:49:17,958
Come on.

623
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:22,754
Sit down, sit down. Come on, sit down.

624
00:49:23,672 --> 00:49:26,925
The scrap out at the caves.
I should have known that was you.

625
00:49:28,135 --> 00:49:30,721
It was the same people that stole Aztec.

626
00:49:31,638 --> 00:49:33,765
-What's Aztec?
-A biochemical weapon.

627
00:49:33,849 --> 00:49:37,644
Very nasty. Deadly enough
to wipe out the Eastern Seaboard.

628
00:49:37,728 --> 00:49:38,562
That's classified.

629
00:49:38,645 --> 00:49:39,897
They're going to sell it.

630
00:49:41,565 --> 00:49:42,566
Thank you for filling me in.

631
00:49:42,649 --> 00:49:45,611
And they're using those caves
with highly paid protection.

632
00:49:45,694 --> 00:49:47,905
There's only one man
that can pull this off.

633
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:50,782
Leveque. Disgraced French intelligence.

634
00:49:50,866 --> 00:49:53,327
Played in this sandbox
for most of the war,

635
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:56,955
and then he went into business
for himself. Arms deals, assassinations.

636
00:49:57,539 --> 00:50:00,209
If he's your target, be careful.
He's a dangerous man.

637
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:03,754
Anyway, mate, best chaat in town.

638
00:50:03,837 --> 00:50:05,088
Enjoy it.

639
00:50:05,172 --> 00:50:09,134
This is yours, sunflower.
Extra spicy. Just how you like it.

640
00:50:13,222 --> 00:50:17,768
So, are you two, you know, a couple?

641
00:50:17,851 --> 00:50:19,061
-Yeah.
-No.

642
00:50:19,144 --> 00:50:20,687
-Yes. Yeah.
-No.

643
00:50:20,771 --> 00:50:22,814
-It was like five months.
-A long time.

644
00:50:23,524 --> 00:50:26,109
You know, we had a lot in common.
You know, work. Not work.

645
00:50:26,193 --> 00:50:27,402
Hey, Mahmoud.

646
00:50:27,486 --> 00:50:28,820
Got it. Subtle.

647
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:34,034
It's not that.
It's just that sometimes it's easier

648
00:50:34,117 --> 00:50:35,536
to date someone in the same profession.

649
00:50:35,619 --> 00:50:36,453
Always.

650
00:50:37,204 --> 00:50:39,414
Although I wouldn't call
what we did dating.

651
00:50:39,498 --> 00:50:40,749
Please. Can we focus?

652
00:50:40,832 --> 00:50:42,167
Well, that's charming. Very cool.

653
00:50:42,251 --> 00:50:43,710
-Okay.
-Very cool.

654
00:50:44,336 --> 00:50:45,337
I need to find Aztec.

655
00:50:46,213 --> 00:50:49,299
And I need your guys to get Cole
back safely to America.

656
00:50:49,383 --> 00:50:52,344
-Who is he really?
-Nobody.

657
00:50:53,303 --> 00:50:54,346
He's a mistake.

658
00:50:55,389 --> 00:50:56,390
You're the mistake.

659
00:50:56,473 --> 00:50:58,016
She said she was an art curator.

660
00:50:58,976 --> 00:51:00,352
-Wait a second.
-Oh, my God.

661
00:51:00,936 --> 00:51:02,312
You said-- What?

662
00:51:02,396 --> 00:51:04,773
Is he your boyfriend?

663
00:51:04,857 --> 00:51:05,691
He's very funny.

664
00:51:05,774 --> 00:51:07,150
You poor bastard.

665
00:51:07,234 --> 00:51:09,695
You thought you met a hottie, right?
Not a Mata Hari.

666
00:51:09,778 --> 00:51:12,114
But, hey, at least the no pants dance
was worth it.

667
00:51:12,197 --> 00:51:14,408
-Oh, God.
-No, it wasn't.

668
00:51:14,491 --> 00:51:15,534
Come on.

669
00:51:15,617 --> 00:51:17,452
Oh, come on. It was. It was for me.

670
00:51:17,536 --> 00:51:18,704
And I lost a hand.

671
00:51:19,204 --> 00:51:20,163
Lost it.

672
00:51:20,747 --> 00:51:23,000
-Wait. You lo--
-Yeah, gone. It's fake.

673
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:24,418
-Touch it.
-That's because of Sadie?

674
00:51:24,501 --> 00:51:27,462
-Yeah. You can touch it.
-No. I'm okay. How?

675
00:51:27,546 --> 00:51:28,839
When Sadie and I were together,

676
00:51:28,922 --> 00:51:31,300
we took a little
romantic getaway to Myanmar.

677
00:51:31,383 --> 00:51:33,260
No. It was a mission.

678
00:51:33,343 --> 00:51:34,720
There were many positions.

679
00:51:34,803 --> 00:51:37,514
Don't know if you remember, but anyway.
Things went south.

680
00:51:37,598 --> 00:51:40,559
I got captured, and Sadie took right off.

681
00:51:40,642 --> 00:51:43,896
Turns out that's exactly
what the secret police did to me.

682
00:51:43,979 --> 00:51:46,356
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah, don't worry about it, man.

683
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,859
You got two hands, right,
but only one life.

684
00:51:51,695 --> 00:51:53,614
You know what I miss most, mate? Guess.

685
00:52:00,287 --> 00:52:02,331
-Yeah.
-I used to do that all the time.

686
00:52:02,414 --> 00:52:03,707
Can't do it anymore, can I?

687
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:07,669
Sorry. You left your boyfriend
to get his hand cut off.

688
00:52:07,753 --> 00:52:09,713
-What the hell is wrong with you?
-Nothing.

689
00:52:10,422 --> 00:52:12,758
I'd have done the same. Mission over man.

690
00:52:12,841 --> 00:52:14,301
Right, sunflower?

691
00:52:14,384 --> 00:52:17,179
Surrounded by lunatics. Wait a minute.

692
00:52:17,262 --> 00:52:19,973
Did you come back to save me or get Aztec?

693
00:52:21,183 --> 00:52:22,893
You were a secondary objective.

694
00:52:22,976 --> 00:52:26,522
-Oh, my God.
-High-priority secondary, I'm sure.

695
00:52:26,605 --> 00:52:28,649
And look at you now, brother. Thriving.

696
00:52:28,732 --> 00:52:30,984
Every word you're saying
is making it worse.

697
00:52:31,068 --> 00:52:33,153
-Every word. I know you're trying. Just--
-Marco.

698
00:52:33,237 --> 00:52:34,738
-This guy.
-Hey.

699
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:37,824
Are you gonna take him back home or not?

700
00:52:38,825 --> 00:52:39,785
Please say yes.

701
00:52:39,868 --> 00:52:43,956
I'd really hate it if one of my limbs
comes between Sadie and a clean exit.

702
00:52:45,749 --> 00:52:48,919
Sure. Sadie survivors
have to look after each other, right?

703
00:52:49,002 --> 00:52:50,003
Thank you.

704
00:52:50,087 --> 00:52:51,505
Honestly, thank you so much.

705
00:52:51,588 --> 00:52:52,673
You're welcome, babe. Kiss?

706
00:52:52,756 --> 00:52:53,757
No.

707
00:52:54,883 --> 00:52:56,051
No.

708
00:52:56,134 --> 00:52:57,302
Goodbye, Cole.

709
00:52:59,888 --> 00:53:01,807
I'm glad that you survived.

710
00:53:07,396 --> 00:53:09,147
I just wanna be very clear.

711
00:53:09,231 --> 00:53:12,025
Do not ever contact me again.

712
00:53:12,109 --> 00:53:14,778
-Okay?
-With pleasure.

713
00:53:15,529 --> 00:53:17,447
I've already forgotten your name.

714
00:53:17,531 --> 00:53:19,616
Which I'm sure by the way
is fake anyway, so…

715
00:53:24,162 --> 00:53:26,331
-Unbelievable.
-Tell me about it.

716
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:29,960
She went for a normie,
but that's just lying to herself.

717
00:53:30,043 --> 00:53:31,420
-Yeah.
-Anyway, cheer up, mate.

718
00:53:31,503 --> 00:53:34,464
Stop staring at her. Stop crying.
You're safe now. Come on.

719
00:53:34,548 --> 00:53:36,341
We got a cheeky bottle-o in the back.

720
00:53:36,425 --> 00:53:38,886
On the piss, you and me get drunk,
get smashed.

721
00:53:38,969 --> 00:53:40,012
Alcohol in your mouth.

722
00:53:40,095 --> 00:53:42,556
This is my town. Nothing happens here
that I don't see coming a mile away.

723
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,935
Everything but that I guess.

724
00:53:51,773 --> 00:53:54,067
Walk. Both of you.

725
00:53:57,362 --> 00:54:00,032
-Sorry about Marco.
-Stop talking before you get us killed.

726
00:54:00,115 --> 00:54:02,117
Don't worry. They want him alive.

727
00:54:02,201 --> 00:54:05,162
I don't know what your deal is,
but I'm sure they'll pay for you too.

728
00:54:05,245 --> 00:54:08,415
-They definitely will.
-Cole, shut up. Just--

729
00:54:08,916 --> 00:54:10,459
I'm trying to keep you alive.

730
00:54:10,542 --> 00:54:12,169
Would you rather I say
they wouldn't pay for you?

731
00:54:12,252 --> 00:54:14,004
This is so cute. Get a room.

732
00:54:14,087 --> 00:54:16,507
If it means anything, he's not the Taxman.

733
00:54:17,007 --> 00:54:19,968
Yeah, and I'm not the Grandson of Sam.

734
00:54:20,052 --> 00:54:23,680
Huh? Like the Son of Sam,
the serial killer, but next gen.

735
00:54:24,431 --> 00:54:25,891
I'm the best bounty hunter alive.

736
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:32,356
Second best.

737
00:54:32,856 --> 00:54:34,316
That was very impressive.

738
00:54:37,653 --> 00:54:40,030
-Shall we?
-Yep, yep. Yep.

739
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,909
You disappointed me, Taxman.
That was too easy.

740
00:54:43,992 --> 00:54:46,078
Now your lady friend's gonna die
'cause of you.

741
00:54:46,161 --> 00:54:48,747
That's funny.
Usually the other way around.

742
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:50,249
It was you who followed me to Europe.

743
00:54:50,332 --> 00:54:51,875
Lured by your lying.

744
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:53,669
God, you two need to get a room.

745
00:54:53,752 --> 00:54:56,088
We did. That's what got us into this mess.

746
00:54:56,171 --> 00:54:57,464
Okay, get in the car.

747
00:55:00,384 --> 00:55:02,886
Lady drives. Taxman, you're riding middle.

748
00:55:06,056 --> 00:55:07,432
Scooch, scooch.

749
00:55:09,226 --> 00:55:11,186
Well, Taxman it up.

750
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:12,813
Don't use Taxman as a verb.

751
00:55:14,982 --> 00:55:16,525
You mind telling us who you are?

752
00:55:17,943 --> 00:55:19,403
They call me the Leopard.

753
00:55:21,363 --> 00:55:22,823
Oh, my God.

754
00:55:22,906 --> 00:55:24,408
Called him the Leopard.

755
00:55:24,491 --> 00:55:27,744
But even leopards get killed by lions,

756
00:55:27,828 --> 00:55:30,289
hyenas, lightning.

757
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:32,749
Get him out.

758
00:55:38,547 --> 00:55:39,715
And drive.

759
00:55:45,262 --> 00:55:46,263
And who are you?

760
00:55:49,766 --> 00:55:51,727
God. The Bounty Hunter.

761
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:55,689
Wow. You guys have really good names
in your world.

762
00:55:55,772 --> 00:55:59,193
It's like the WWE, but scarier.

763
00:56:03,155 --> 00:56:07,075
One twist of this ring will send
50,000 volts through your sorry ass.

764
00:56:08,368 --> 00:56:11,330
-Make you wish you were dead.
-Too late.

765
00:56:11,413 --> 00:56:13,957
This is great. Thank you for this.

766
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:16,251
-Huh?
-No, I was just thinking how happy I am

767
00:56:16,335 --> 00:56:18,795
to have an electrified hockey puck
stuck to my neck with what,

768
00:56:18,879 --> 00:56:20,964
-50,000 volts ready to go into--
-I can't take this.

769
00:56:21,048 --> 00:56:22,633
-Volts into my--
-You really need to shut up.

770
00:56:22,716 --> 00:56:23,550
Wow.

771
00:56:23,634 --> 00:56:25,511
You two should get a room.

772
00:56:27,387 --> 00:56:28,847
You know what? Stop.

773
00:56:28,931 --> 00:56:30,098
Pull over here.

774
00:56:30,182 --> 00:56:31,225
My car is better.

775
00:56:40,692 --> 00:56:42,778
Look, I don't mean to
shake your confidence, God,

776
00:56:42,861 --> 00:56:44,404
but the last two guys didn't make it.

777
00:56:44,488 --> 00:56:45,906
My confidence doesn't shake.

778
00:56:46,532 --> 00:56:50,077
I spent years conditioning myself
to attuning my sense--

779
00:56:55,624 --> 00:56:58,085
Got you, suckers.

780
00:57:11,974 --> 00:57:15,477
If you're collecting the bounty,
where are they taking delivery?

781
00:57:24,486 --> 00:57:27,406
Listen, I'll stash you someplace safe.

782
00:57:27,489 --> 00:57:30,784
If I don't come back for you,
an extraction team will.

783
00:57:30,868 --> 00:57:34,413
So you're really gonna raid a plane
full of armed goons by yourself?

784
00:57:34,496 --> 00:57:37,791
I have to find Aztec. It's my only play.

785
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:39,751
Wow.

786
00:57:45,841 --> 00:57:49,720
Well, for what it's worth,
I'm sorry about Marco.

787
00:57:49,803 --> 00:57:51,346
God. Seriously?

788
00:57:52,181 --> 00:57:55,517
You know, I'm trying to connect
about a person that just died.

789
00:57:55,601 --> 00:57:57,227
Someone you knew well.

790
00:57:57,311 --> 00:57:59,521
Are you capable of that,
or is that only on first dates?

791
00:57:59,605 --> 00:58:03,317
The rest of the time, it's just
chemical weapons and passcodes

792
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,818
and bullets and death.

793
00:58:04,902 --> 00:58:07,613
Wait, what passcodes?
What do you mean about passcodes?

794
00:58:07,696 --> 00:58:12,409
The bug guy in the cave
kept asking me about passcodes.

795
00:58:13,202 --> 00:58:14,494
Jesus!

796
00:58:16,121 --> 00:58:18,498
-He thinks I have the passcode?
-Yeah.

797
00:58:18,582 --> 00:58:20,167
And you're telling me this now?

798
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:21,460
I'm sorry.

799
00:58:21,543 --> 00:58:24,046
I was slightly drugged and kidnapped
at the time.

800
00:58:24,129 --> 00:58:24,963
Unbelievable.

801
00:58:25,047 --> 00:58:27,674
Also, in case you forgot, I'm a farmer.

802
00:58:27,758 --> 00:58:29,426
I'm not a super spy.

803
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:32,971
Why didn't you just ask me
what the torturer was torturing me about?

804
00:58:33,055 --> 00:58:34,348
You are unbelievable!

805
00:58:34,431 --> 00:58:36,141
What? What?

806
00:58:36,225 --> 00:58:37,935
What are the passcodes?

807
00:58:38,018 --> 00:58:40,854
The least you could do is tell me
what I almost died for.

808
00:58:43,815 --> 00:58:48,570
Aztec is inside a high-security case
that cannot be opened without a passcode.

809
00:58:48,654 --> 00:58:50,989
Elena figured out the DNA encryption.

810
00:58:51,073 --> 00:58:52,366
What do you mean, DNA encryption?

811
00:58:52,449 --> 00:58:55,953
The passcode is the entire genetic
sequence of a living organism.

812
00:58:56,036 --> 00:58:58,705
-Insanely long and unique.
-Wow.

813
00:58:58,789 --> 00:59:01,291
I got to Elena
before she could upload it to Leveque.

814
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:03,043
So they think you have the passcode?

815
00:59:03,126 --> 00:59:06,004
But I don't because she destroyed it.

816
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:10,175
But if Leveque
is trying to get it from me,

817
00:59:10,259 --> 00:59:12,135
that means he doesn't have it either.

818
00:59:12,636 --> 00:59:15,138
Which means he can't
hand the weapon over to his buyers.

819
00:59:15,222 --> 00:59:17,641
-Which means--
-He still has Aztec.

820
00:59:17,724 --> 00:59:20,018
Which means change of plans.

821
00:59:20,102 --> 00:59:21,353
Do you trust me?

822
00:59:21,436 --> 00:59:23,188
Is that a fucking joke?

823
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:25,274
Thank you for your honesty.

824
00:59:38,453 --> 00:59:40,372
You're a f-- I cannot believe--

825
00:59:40,455 --> 00:59:43,125
'Cause I'm the taxman

826
00:59:44,793 --> 00:59:48,881
Yeah, I'm the taxman

827
00:59:50,465 --> 00:59:53,427
-Get it?
-The song? Very funny.

828
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:56,513
You left an impressive trail of blood
bringing us our friend.

829
00:59:57,931 --> 01:00:00,184
-Well done.
-Thanks.

830
01:00:00,267 --> 01:00:01,810
But I don't get paid in compliments.

831
01:00:04,104 --> 01:00:06,523
You'll get your money, bounty hunter.

832
01:00:14,531 --> 01:00:16,158
So you're the Taxman.

833
01:00:16,992 --> 01:00:19,244
CIA's golden boy.

834
01:00:21,371 --> 01:00:25,083
Your pseudonym has generated
as much fun as you have.

835
01:00:25,709 --> 01:00:26,960
But I know you.

836
01:00:31,632 --> 01:00:34,176
I know you because I was you.

837
01:00:35,302 --> 01:00:36,803
Disposable.

838
01:00:37,471 --> 01:00:41,266
Except one day, I found myself

839
01:00:42,392 --> 01:00:46,396
bleeding out in a ditch
on the edge of Kabul.

840
01:00:51,693 --> 01:00:53,987
There was trash everywhere.

841
01:00:54,696 --> 01:00:58,408
And then suddenly, I got clarity.

842
01:01:00,077 --> 01:01:02,204
I had given them everything

843
01:01:03,455 --> 01:01:05,666
and sacrificed everything.

844
01:01:07,417 --> 01:01:09,837
It is a waste of life.

845
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:13,257
And what are we?

846
01:01:15,884 --> 01:01:17,094
Instruments.

847
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,097
Expendable.

848
01:01:21,306 --> 01:01:23,350
We deserve better.

849
01:01:35,153 --> 01:01:39,408
Tell me the passcode and walk away.

850
01:01:41,785 --> 01:01:42,870
If you don't…

851
01:01:44,037 --> 01:01:46,206
well, we both know how that will go.

852
01:01:46,874 --> 01:01:48,458
I will get what I want…

853
01:01:50,627 --> 01:01:52,504
and you will die anyway.

854
01:01:53,463 --> 01:01:54,965
For nothing.

855
01:01:58,677 --> 01:02:00,512
I swear to God,
I don't know what the passcode is.

856
01:02:00,596 --> 01:02:01,805
I'm not even the Taxman.

857
01:02:02,598 --> 01:02:03,473
Shut up.

858
01:02:06,185 --> 01:02:07,311
Can we get back to business?

859
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,771
Is that my money?

860
01:02:12,691 --> 01:02:15,611
Your payment will be wired soon.

861
01:02:15,694 --> 01:02:18,447
Rumor has it
you stole a weapon you can't use,

862
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:20,157
so you're overextended.

863
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,410
And now you want me to work on what?
Credit?

864
01:02:23,493 --> 01:02:25,329
No, no.

865
01:02:25,412 --> 01:02:26,413
Cash.

866
01:02:27,289 --> 01:02:30,417
And until I get it,
he doesn't leave my sight.

867
01:02:30,501 --> 01:02:32,294
Or we just kill you.

868
01:02:35,339 --> 01:02:38,675
And make your boss
the guy who offers big paydays

869
01:02:38,759 --> 01:02:40,344
and kills anyone who delivers?

870
01:02:41,386 --> 01:02:42,888
Let me guess.

871
01:02:42,971 --> 01:02:45,766
This is the idiot
who lost him to begin with.

872
01:02:45,849 --> 01:02:48,101
You'll get your cash when you land.

873
01:02:52,064 --> 01:02:53,106
She called you an idiot.

874
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:54,566
Yeah.

875
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:55,943
To your face.

876
01:02:56,902 --> 01:02:59,571
Kill her when you touch down.

877
01:03:01,031 --> 01:03:02,866
Get that passcode.

878
01:03:03,742 --> 01:03:06,078
I expect that to be open
next time I see you.

879
01:03:06,161 --> 01:03:07,162
You're not coming?

880
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:12,918
If anything should go wrong
when you open that case…

881
01:03:16,463 --> 01:03:18,549
…everyone on board dies.

882
01:03:18,632 --> 01:03:19,800
No pressure.

883
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:22,261
Yes, sir.

884
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:39,695
We're looking for a genetic sequence.

885
01:03:40,737 --> 01:03:42,197
Do you know what "genetic" means?

886
01:03:51,206 --> 01:03:52,416
That's a cactus.

887
01:03:55,502 --> 01:03:56,753
Thirsty?

888
01:04:08,223 --> 01:04:09,766
-Be smart.
-Sociopath.

889
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:11,476
I'm not a sociopath.

890
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,812
You know who says that a lot? Sociopaths.

891
01:04:19,401 --> 01:04:23,405
I have dated some crazies in my day,
but you are certifiable.

892
01:04:23,488 --> 01:04:25,741
This is bigger than you and me.

893
01:04:26,533 --> 01:04:28,035
And my plan worked.

894
01:04:28,744 --> 01:04:29,745
Better than I imagined.

895
01:04:29,828 --> 01:04:30,829
Really?

896
01:04:31,371 --> 01:04:33,373
Did you imagine
I'd make it out of this alive?

897
01:04:33,457 --> 01:04:34,833
We found Aztec.

898
01:04:39,213 --> 01:04:41,757
As soon as we land,
we'll take these guys down.

899
01:04:42,549 --> 01:04:43,592
We'll be safe.

900
01:04:43,675 --> 01:04:45,886
The world will be safe. Everybody wins.

901
01:04:53,936 --> 01:04:55,312
What's all this?

902
01:04:55,395 --> 01:04:56,396
What's…

903
01:04:58,315 --> 01:04:59,316
all this?

904
01:05:06,532 --> 01:05:08,617
I would expect more discretion

905
01:05:10,118 --> 01:05:11,161
from the Taxman.

906
01:05:11,954 --> 01:05:13,205
So would I.

907
01:05:14,873 --> 01:05:16,375
So what are you really?

908
01:05:17,334 --> 01:05:18,710
Hired help?

909
01:05:19,878 --> 01:05:20,712
Or just the girlfriend?

910
01:05:20,796 --> 01:05:23,006
Believe me, she's not girlfriend material.

911
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:24,132
You know, I don't care.

912
01:05:25,342 --> 01:05:26,969
You die either way.

913
01:05:28,053 --> 01:05:29,847
Hey, hey, hey. Wait, wait. Wait.

914
01:05:30,931 --> 01:05:32,641
Who's the idiot now?

915
01:05:32,724 --> 01:05:34,059
I have the passcode.

916
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:37,145
Bullshit.

917
01:05:37,896 --> 01:05:38,897
He doesn't have it.

918
01:05:39,481 --> 01:05:40,482
I do.

919
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:42,985
Really?

920
01:05:43,819 --> 01:05:44,903
So we can kill him.

921
01:05:46,822 --> 01:05:48,907
Hey! Wait. Okay. Wait.

922
01:05:48,991 --> 01:05:50,826
The passcode. Now!

923
01:05:52,327 --> 01:05:54,413
Sure. It's in my pocket.

924
01:05:58,041 --> 01:05:59,042
We're good.

925
01:06:05,716 --> 01:06:06,800
Really?

926
01:06:06,884 --> 01:06:07,885
Open it.

927
01:06:38,248 --> 01:06:39,333
Shit!

928
01:06:45,339 --> 01:06:48,008
I can't believe you took a picture of me
while I was sleeping!

929
01:06:48,091 --> 01:06:49,468
Not of you, of us!

930
01:06:49,551 --> 01:06:50,928
I knew you were a creep!

931
01:06:55,224 --> 01:06:56,225
I'm not a creep!

932
01:06:56,308 --> 01:06:58,393
You know who says that a lot? Creeps!

933
01:08:07,045 --> 01:08:08,797
Let me see. Let me see. Let me see.

934
01:08:09,965 --> 01:08:11,133
Oh, my God.

935
01:08:11,216 --> 01:08:12,801
Take the case and go.

936
01:08:14,595 --> 01:08:17,055
-There is a parachute.
-What about you?

937
01:08:17,139 --> 01:08:18,807
Mission over man.

938
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:22,060
No. No. I gotta stop this bleeding first.
You're losing a lot of blood.

939
01:08:22,144 --> 01:08:23,187
-Just go, Cole.
-I gotta find…

940
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:25,022
-Cole, go! Go!
-Sadie, I'm telling you right--

941
01:08:26,982 --> 01:08:28,024
Get out of here.

942
01:08:35,282 --> 01:08:36,200
Hey!

943
01:08:44,082 --> 01:08:45,959
Get out of the way, you idiot.

944
01:08:48,545 --> 01:08:49,462
What are you doing?

945
01:08:49,546 --> 01:08:50,631
I have no idea.

946
01:09:19,535 --> 01:09:20,661
Sadie?

947
01:09:22,162 --> 01:09:23,663
God.

948
01:09:28,502 --> 01:09:29,670
I told you to go.

949
01:09:32,631 --> 01:09:33,631
I did.

950
01:09:34,131 --> 01:09:35,509
I just took you with me.

951
01:09:36,093 --> 01:09:37,219
How long was I out?

952
01:09:37,301 --> 01:09:38,595
A while.

953
01:09:40,264 --> 01:09:42,558
Looks like you got creative
with the parachute.

954
01:09:44,434 --> 01:09:45,644
I had a lot of nervous energy.

955
01:09:53,234 --> 01:09:54,236
You got it.

956
01:09:54,903 --> 01:09:55,988
Yeah. Yeah.

957
01:09:56,488 --> 01:09:57,739
You got it.

958
01:09:57,823 --> 01:09:59,741
-You got Aztec.
-Yeah.

959
01:10:01,451 --> 01:10:03,120
-Wait. Take it easy.
-I mean, do you have a--

960
01:10:03,203 --> 01:10:04,663
You lost a lot of blood.

961
01:10:07,165 --> 01:10:08,166
It was really gross.

962
01:10:10,252 --> 01:10:12,045
I'm sorry. I don't know what to say.

963
01:10:13,755 --> 01:10:14,756
Thank you.

964
01:10:15,507 --> 01:10:16,508
You're welcome.

965
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:39,531
Pardon me. Excuse me. Pardon.

966
01:10:41,116 --> 01:10:42,201
Hello?

967
01:10:42,284 --> 01:10:44,077
Leveque, things didn't go as planned.

968
01:10:44,995 --> 01:10:46,496
The girl sprung the Taxman.

969
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:48,999
How many times can you lose one man?

970
01:10:49,875 --> 01:10:51,210
Listen carefully.

971
01:10:51,293 --> 01:10:54,379
If we do not deliver
an operational weapon in 48 hours,

972
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:55,881
our buyers will kill us all.

973
01:10:56,673 --> 01:10:58,300
Now, you find the Taxman,

974
01:10:59,384 --> 01:11:03,347
or they will not have the chance
because I will kill you myself.

975
01:11:07,059 --> 01:11:09,353
Boss. We have a sighting of the parachute.

976
01:11:11,188 --> 01:11:12,356
Good.

977
01:11:22,533 --> 01:11:25,327
You know,
I think, depending on your strength,

978
01:11:26,161 --> 01:11:28,372
we should consider maybe hiking
out of here tomorrow.

979
01:11:28,956 --> 01:11:30,207
Depending on your strength.

980
01:11:33,919 --> 01:11:36,547
You have to tell me. What is this gunk?

981
01:11:37,339 --> 01:11:39,675
It's periwinkle and gavilana.

982
01:11:39,758 --> 01:11:42,261
I found it up the beach,
smashed it up and put it in there

983
01:11:42,344 --> 01:11:44,763
to stop the bleeding
and fight the infection.

984
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:48,058
-How did you know how to do that?
-I read about it.

985
01:11:49,059 --> 01:11:52,729
Throughout history, every culture has
their own knowledge of the crops they grow

986
01:11:53,272 --> 01:11:55,732
for food or clothing, medicine.

987
01:11:57,401 --> 01:12:00,529
I just don't get why you never left
the country.

988
01:12:01,613 --> 01:12:03,031
-Here we go.
-What? I'm serious.

989
01:12:03,115 --> 01:12:05,117
You're clearly interested in the world.

990
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:10,205
I wanted to travel. I really did.
I thought I was gonna after I graduated.

991
01:12:10,289 --> 01:12:12,624
You know, research the book.
Then my dad got hurt…

992
01:12:15,752 --> 01:12:16,753
just went home.

993
01:12:18,589 --> 01:12:19,882
He never recovered?

994
01:12:20,674 --> 01:12:22,342
No, he did. He's good now.

995
01:12:22,426 --> 01:12:24,720
But you know, he's getting old.

996
01:12:24,803 --> 01:12:27,848
And you know,
we got to keep production high to compete,

997
01:12:27,931 --> 01:12:29,766
and business is changing.

998
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:30,851
Anyway…

999
01:12:32,519 --> 01:12:33,562
They need me there.

1000
01:12:34,646 --> 01:12:35,647
Do they?

1001
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,654
What about you? Your mom must be proud.

1002
01:12:42,738 --> 01:12:45,490
Daughter's a CIA agent. Right?

1003
01:12:47,951 --> 01:12:49,328
I'd like to think she'd be.

1004
01:12:52,664 --> 01:12:54,583
My mom died when I was very young.

1005
01:12:55,459 --> 01:12:58,170
-God, I'm sorry. I didn't know.
-It's okay.

1006
01:12:58,253 --> 01:13:01,298
I promise. It happened so long ago.

1007
01:13:02,216 --> 01:13:06,011
You know, and then after she died,
I found the army.

1008
01:13:06,512 --> 01:13:10,390
You know,
somewhere where I could put my focus.

1009
01:13:10,974 --> 01:13:14,645
And then the agency, they gave me purpose.

1010
01:13:17,481 --> 01:13:21,276
Our struggles make us stronger. Right?

1011
01:13:23,403 --> 01:13:24,571
Any other family?

1012
01:13:26,532 --> 01:13:29,409
In my line of work,
it's better being alone.

1013
01:13:30,786 --> 01:13:31,787
Is it?

1014
01:13:37,543 --> 01:13:40,754
For what it's worth, I think
that any parent would be very proud…

1015
01:13:42,172 --> 01:13:43,340
of you.

1016
01:13:47,427 --> 01:13:48,554
You know what?

1017
01:13:48,637 --> 01:13:52,599
I just can't believe that that little shit
is still in one piece.

1018
01:13:53,433 --> 01:13:55,727
Maybe you can keep
a cactus alive after all.

1019
01:13:56,979 --> 01:13:57,980
Maybe.

1020
01:14:09,324 --> 01:14:10,742
I'm sorry about the selfie.

1021
01:14:11,451 --> 01:14:13,078
I'm sorry about the gag.

1022
01:14:13,161 --> 01:14:14,538
Call it even?

1023
01:14:14,621 --> 01:14:15,622
Deal.

1024
01:14:59,666 --> 01:15:00,709
Run!

1025
01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:06,840
Get me the Taxman alive, kill the girl,
and I'll get Aztec.

1026
01:15:18,602 --> 01:15:19,728
Move! Move!

1027
01:15:21,688 --> 01:15:22,814
There she is.

1028
01:15:32,157 --> 01:15:34,743
Attention.
This is the United States Marines.

1029
01:15:34,826 --> 01:15:38,205
Safety your weapons
and drop them on the ground.

1030
01:15:54,304 --> 01:15:55,639
Damn it.

1031
01:16:23,876 --> 01:16:25,127
Where's the case?

1032
01:16:30,716 --> 01:16:33,927
Agent Rhodes. It's time to go home.

1033
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:37,598
We're fine. Thanks.

1034
01:16:39,183 --> 01:16:40,309
Let's go.

1035
01:16:48,775 --> 01:16:51,445
-That's not too tight on you now, is it?
-No.

1036
01:16:51,528 --> 01:16:53,280
Okay. Just wanna make sure.

1037
01:16:53,363 --> 01:16:54,406
Yeah, that's good.

1038
01:16:56,617 --> 01:16:58,452
A polygraph, Jackson?

1039
01:16:58,535 --> 01:17:01,246
Are you really
this desperate to jump ahead of me?

1040
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,875
I'm just doing my job, Rhodes.

1041
01:17:04,958 --> 01:17:08,337
No, if you were doing your job,
you'd be out there looking for Aztec.

1042
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:10,380
If you had done yours,
we never would have lost it.

1043
01:17:10,464 --> 01:17:13,467
Well, it wasn't her fault.
She was just trying to save me.

1044
01:17:16,261 --> 01:17:17,387
Of course.

1045
01:17:18,347 --> 01:17:20,891
The boyfriend,
accidentally along for the ride.

1046
01:17:20,974 --> 01:17:23,435
Didn't it ever occur to you
that he could be a foreign asset,

1047
01:17:23,519 --> 01:17:24,770
trying to compromise your mission?

1048
01:17:25,687 --> 01:17:31,109
Yeah. Six-foot honeypot sent to kiss
and nibble the secrets right out of you.

1049
01:17:31,193 --> 01:17:33,612
Patti, just watch the machine, please.

1050
01:17:33,695 --> 01:17:35,447
Right. Sorry.

1051
01:17:35,531 --> 01:17:40,160
We both know you checked him out.
He's a civilian, and he's clean.

1052
01:17:41,328 --> 01:17:42,746
{\an8}Some civilian.

1053
01:17:42,829 --> 01:17:47,584
Because you chose his life over thousands,
if Aztec is ever deployed.

1054
01:17:47,668 --> 01:17:50,045
I let my emotions cloud my judgment.

1055
01:17:52,172 --> 01:17:53,173
Wait a minute.

1056
01:17:55,843 --> 01:18:00,055
{\an8}Are you saying you think
it was a mistake to save my life?

1057
01:18:02,808 --> 01:18:03,725
Yes.

1058
01:18:10,732 --> 01:18:11,733
That's great.

1059
01:18:12,901 --> 01:18:14,236
That's great.

1060
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:18,782
Cole, I'm sorry, but they're right.
One life compared to thousands.

1061
01:18:18,866 --> 01:18:21,535
Yeah, no, I get it.
Mission over man justifies everything.

1062
01:18:21,618 --> 01:18:23,954
Marco's hand,
using me as bait at the airstrip.

1063
01:18:24,037 --> 01:18:25,581
-I get it.
-You used him as bait?

1064
01:18:25,664 --> 01:18:26,498
-Yes.
-No.

1065
01:18:26,582 --> 01:18:27,958
Well…

1066
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:30,711
Marco was right about you.
You should date someone just like him.

1067
01:18:30,794 --> 01:18:33,255
Completely cut off
from emotional connection

1068
01:18:33,338 --> 01:18:34,756
-and not afraid to lose a limb.
-What?

1069
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:37,759
You know what?
Marco was right, but not about that.

1070
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:42,306
We only have one life,
and you are too afraid to live it.

1071
01:18:42,389 --> 01:18:43,599
Says the one-handed dead guy.

1072
01:18:43,682 --> 01:18:44,725
What's happening?

1073
01:18:44,808 --> 01:18:46,894
Cole, you went to your parents' house
to help them.

1074
01:18:46,977 --> 01:18:48,896
But I don't think they need you anymore.

1075
01:18:48,979 --> 01:18:50,981
I think
they're just an excuse to avoid life.

1076
01:18:51,064 --> 01:18:52,191
Look who's talking.

1077
01:18:52,274 --> 01:18:56,862
Your job, the duty, the sacrifice,
that's your excuse to keep people out.

1078
01:18:56,945 --> 01:18:58,572
I think you're afraid
to get close to people.

1079
01:18:58,655 --> 01:18:59,948
'Cause if you do, you might lose them.

1080
01:19:00,032 --> 01:19:01,325
-Just like you lost your mother.
-Hey!

1081
01:19:02,367 --> 01:19:04,828
You don't talk about her!

1082
01:19:08,999 --> 01:19:10,751
And I'm not afraid of anything.

1083
01:19:13,212 --> 01:19:15,130
You two need to get a room.

1084
01:19:16,215 --> 01:19:17,382
-Oh, my God.
-Patti,

1085
01:19:17,466 --> 01:19:18,800
he's not even hooked up to the machine.

1086
01:19:18,884 --> 01:19:22,638
I'm sorry. But, you guys,
the sexual tension in the room is just--

1087
01:19:22,721 --> 01:19:23,972
The boss wants to see you.

1088
01:19:31,813 --> 01:19:33,774
So much for starting with a houseplant.

1089
01:19:37,027 --> 01:19:38,820
I know she pulled you into this…

1090
01:19:41,198 --> 01:19:42,074
but…

1091
01:19:44,952 --> 01:19:46,203
you're still in deep shit.

1092
01:19:46,995 --> 01:19:48,413
You're facing prosecution.

1093
01:19:48,497 --> 01:19:50,999
For what? Visiting a girl in London?

1094
01:19:51,083 --> 01:19:52,334
Why are you protecting her?

1095
01:19:52,417 --> 01:19:55,963
I know this looks bad. I can fix it.

1096
01:19:56,046 --> 01:19:57,422
We can still get Leveque.

1097
01:19:57,506 --> 01:20:00,300
You were always my favorite, Sadie.

1098
01:20:00,384 --> 01:20:03,387
But you going rogue,
there's nothing I can do.

1099
01:20:03,971 --> 01:20:04,888
What do you mean?

1100
01:20:04,972 --> 01:20:07,391
She didn't lose Aztec, did she?

1101
01:20:07,474 --> 01:20:09,810
No, no, no, no, no.
She's working an angle.

1102
01:20:09,893 --> 01:20:11,603
-No. No.
-Looking to cash in.

1103
01:20:13,605 --> 01:20:14,940
Sadie would never do that.

1104
01:20:17,317 --> 01:20:20,445
You let Aztec
get into the hands of a known threat.

1105
01:20:20,529 --> 01:20:22,781
You're suspended,
pending a full investigation,

1106
01:20:22,865 --> 01:20:24,700
but you know how these things go.

1107
01:20:24,783 --> 01:20:27,911
You'll be lucky to have a job
at all when it's done.

1108
01:20:30,664 --> 01:20:32,416
Look at what she does.

1109
01:20:32,499 --> 01:20:34,251
And this is just the last six months.

1110
01:20:34,334 --> 01:20:36,587
She's a liar and a killer, Cole.

1111
01:20:37,421 --> 01:20:38,922
Is that someone you want to protect?

1112
01:20:41,508 --> 01:20:42,801
Take home to Mom?

1113
01:20:48,724 --> 01:20:49,975
Oh, my God.

1114
01:20:53,645 --> 01:20:56,648
What am I looking at? A houseplant?

1115
01:20:56,732 --> 01:20:59,860
Well, it's not a houseplant.
That's an amaranth. A crop.

1116
01:21:01,904 --> 01:21:05,073
Farmed in the Americas
for thousands of years, mostly for food,

1117
01:21:05,157 --> 01:21:08,452
but often used in rituals by the Aztecs.

1118
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:14,541
Oh, my God. The plant wasn't hers.
She took it from Horvath, the scientist.

1119
01:21:14,625 --> 01:21:17,628
He was obsessed with the Aztecs' use
of human sacrifice.

1120
01:21:18,545 --> 01:21:21,548
{\an8}The genetic sequence
of that amaranth is the passcode.

1121
01:21:21,632 --> 01:21:23,091
I'll be damned.

1122
01:21:23,175 --> 01:21:26,261
I want that plant retrieved
from Elena's apartment now.

1123
01:21:27,095 --> 01:21:30,766
You know, we can use this to lure
in Leveque. We get a message to him.

1124
01:21:30,849 --> 01:21:33,727
"The Taxman is ready
to sell the passcode."

1125
01:21:33,810 --> 01:21:34,853
He'll never go for it.

1126
01:21:34,937 --> 01:21:36,897
Unless we bait the hook.

1127
01:21:38,065 --> 01:21:40,651
The passcode is divided
into four segments.

1128
01:21:40,734 --> 01:21:42,069
Send Leveque the first.

1129
01:21:42,152 --> 01:21:45,572
What? Give him part of the key?
That's insane.

1130
01:21:45,656 --> 01:21:48,659
Exactly. The agency would never allow it.

1131
01:21:49,326 --> 01:21:53,830
So if the Taxman is doing it, that means
he went rogue and the offer is real.

1132
01:21:55,457 --> 01:21:57,459
Leveque is desperate. He'll bite.

1133
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:03,674
That means we're gonna need the Taxman.

1134
01:22:07,177 --> 01:22:11,265
Me? No, no, no way.

1135
01:22:11,348 --> 01:22:13,600
It's only for appearances.
He won't even get near you.

1136
01:22:13,684 --> 01:22:17,312
Well, then what do you need me for?
Use a dummy. Put Jackson in a disguise.

1137
01:22:17,396 --> 01:22:18,564
That's a great idea.

1138
01:22:18,647 --> 01:22:22,526
Mr. Turner, I know you don't want
to do this, but I also know that you will.

1139
01:22:22,609 --> 01:22:25,946
As long as Leveque thinks
you're the Taxman, you're in danger.

1140
01:22:26,029 --> 01:22:29,783
Well, then put me in protective custody.
Hide me just until you find the guy.

1141
01:22:29,867 --> 01:22:31,201
What about your family?

1142
01:22:32,995 --> 01:22:36,373
-What about my family?
-Guys like Leveque, they never stop.

1143
01:22:36,957 --> 01:22:39,501
The only way
to guarantee your family's safety

1144
01:22:39,585 --> 01:22:41,128
is to take him off the board.

1145
01:22:44,590 --> 01:22:45,632
No, no, no.

1146
01:22:46,216 --> 01:22:50,554
Hey, Cole. Cole, it's too dangerous.

1147
01:22:51,847 --> 01:22:53,015
They're using you.

1148
01:22:53,682 --> 01:22:56,560
Well, that's funny because he just said
the same thing about you.

1149
01:22:56,643 --> 01:22:59,521
Remind me, which one of you
can't stop risking my life?

1150
01:22:59,605 --> 01:23:02,858
I know you're angry,
but this is a mistake.

1151
01:23:04,109 --> 01:23:06,486
Protecting the people you love
is never a mistake.

1152
01:23:08,113 --> 01:23:10,991
Maybe one day you'll care enough
about someone to understand that.

1153
01:23:13,702 --> 01:23:14,828
Rhodes.

1154
01:23:23,212 --> 01:23:25,172
Come on, you have to let me run this.

1155
01:23:25,756 --> 01:23:27,841
I know more about Leveque's operation
than anyone.

1156
01:23:27,925 --> 01:23:30,677
Go home, Sadie. And stay there.

1157
01:23:49,154 --> 01:23:50,155
{\an8}What do you think?

1158
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:52,491
What do I think? I think it is a trap.

1159
01:23:54,368 --> 01:23:55,369
Test it.

1160
01:24:10,634 --> 01:24:11,635
It's genuine.

1161
01:24:13,345 --> 01:24:14,471
Maybe it's not a trap.

1162
01:24:14,555 --> 01:24:19,393
Or maybe it is just a very good one.
Either way, what choice do we have?

1163
01:24:20,185 --> 01:24:21,186
Boss.

1164
01:24:25,566 --> 01:24:28,986
Mr. Utami. Pleasure to see you again.

1165
01:24:29,069 --> 01:24:31,405
Funny. When you accepted my first payment,

1166
01:24:31,488 --> 01:24:33,949
you neglected to mention
that you didn't have the passcode.

1167
01:24:34,032 --> 01:24:38,078
We will have it soon.
Aztec will be yours as promised.

1168
01:24:47,129 --> 01:24:48,255
Mine, I believe.

1169
01:24:50,215 --> 01:24:51,508
You're meeting the Taxman?

1170
01:24:52,968 --> 01:24:54,094
We'll go together.

1171
01:24:55,804 --> 01:25:01,602
If he has the passcode, we conclude
our business. If he doesn't, I kill you.

1172
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:12,821
Mr. Utami, one condition.

1173
01:25:13,822 --> 01:25:16,450
Whatever happens, the Taxman dies.

1174
01:25:17,451 --> 01:25:18,535
So be it.

1175
01:25:58,659 --> 01:26:00,702
Turner,
get in there and make it look good.

1176
01:26:00,786 --> 01:26:02,788
You'll be in and out in 20 minutes.

1177
01:26:07,751 --> 01:26:10,921
Stop messing with your collar. Sounds
like a goddamn thunderstorm in here.

1178
01:26:11,004 --> 01:26:13,799
Sorry, I hate suits.

1179
01:26:28,647 --> 01:26:31,650
-How many guys do you have?
-Including me? Three.

1180
01:26:32,901 --> 01:26:36,071
Three? What do you mean? Three guys total?

1181
01:26:36,154 --> 01:26:38,282
You have three guys total?
You can't do this with three guys.

1182
01:26:38,365 --> 01:26:41,827
The CIA can't operate on US soil.
We had to travel light.

1183
01:26:41,910 --> 01:26:46,039
Travel light?
What are you, backpacking through Europe?

1184
01:26:46,123 --> 01:26:49,334
You're the CIA. What does that even mean?
Travel light?

1185
01:26:49,418 --> 01:26:52,629
Calm down. Leveque's men
just need to see you in there.

1186
01:26:52,713 --> 01:26:54,381
We'll arrest him as soon as he shows.

1187
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:55,799
You got to play the part.

1188
01:26:55,883 --> 01:27:00,387
You're not a farmer anymore. Remember?
You're the Taxman. Now, get in there.

1189
01:27:12,941 --> 01:27:14,276
Hi, welcome in.

1190
01:27:14,359 --> 01:27:15,861
Table for Mr. Taxman.

1191
01:27:15,944 --> 01:27:17,237
Yes, right this way.

1192
01:27:34,505 --> 01:27:35,756
Cheers!

1193
01:27:52,397 --> 01:27:55,067
Everything will be fine.
We've got it all under control,

1194
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:56,985
and the bad guys will never get near you.

1195
01:27:57,069 --> 01:27:58,695
Three guys.

1196
01:28:16,672 --> 01:28:17,965
They're here.

1197
01:28:28,642 --> 01:28:31,520
We got eyes on the target.
He has the weapon.

1198
01:28:32,688 --> 01:28:33,939
Let's get ready to move.

1199
01:28:40,904 --> 01:28:42,531
Jackson. What was that?

1200
01:28:43,866 --> 01:28:45,868
-Cole.
-What?

1201
01:28:45,951 --> 01:28:47,077
Get out of there.

1202
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:50,914
Go now? Okay. Okay. Okay.

1203
01:28:50,998 --> 01:28:52,749
Does this mean we lose Leveque?

1204
01:28:53,458 --> 01:28:55,335
Jackson, what happens to my family
if you lose Leveque?

1205
01:29:04,845 --> 01:29:05,846
I'm staying.

1206
01:29:17,649 --> 01:29:18,775
She's coming.

1207
01:29:20,277 --> 01:29:21,278
I know it.

1208
01:29:43,467 --> 01:29:49,515
Well, well, well, what a romantic spot
for our first official date.

1209
01:30:05,197 --> 01:30:09,159
I brought a little something special
for us to open up.

1210
01:30:12,287 --> 01:30:16,166
And some chaperone. Hope you don't mind.

1211
01:30:18,001 --> 01:30:22,339
I apologize. Yours are no longer with us.

1212
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:25,175
It is more intimate this way, no?

1213
01:30:26,593 --> 01:30:28,220
Are you all right, Taxman?

1214
01:30:30,138 --> 01:30:32,891
I hate to think something
might ruin our night.

1215
01:30:37,855 --> 01:30:40,732
-Thank you.
-For what?

1216
01:30:40,816 --> 01:30:43,110
For helping me with my chaperones.

1217
01:30:43,944 --> 01:30:46,947
Saves me the hassle
of having to kill them myself.

1218
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:50,033
It was my pleasure.

1219
01:30:52,494 --> 01:30:54,413
But somehow I don't believe you.

1220
01:30:55,497 --> 01:30:57,291
Well, I don't care what you believe.

1221
01:30:58,292 --> 01:31:02,546
My intention is to walk out of here
a very rich man and disappear.

1222
01:31:02,629 --> 01:31:06,800
The great Taxman betraying his country.

1223
01:31:08,343 --> 01:31:11,680
No. Why would you do that?

1224
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:17,686
What you said to me
about wasting my life. Made me think.

1225
01:31:20,772 --> 01:31:22,774
Let's not delay this new beginning.

1226
01:31:24,568 --> 01:31:25,652
The passcode.

1227
01:31:31,867 --> 01:31:32,701
Money first.

1228
01:31:34,453 --> 01:31:38,207
And… my price doubled.

1229
01:31:38,290 --> 01:31:40,501
Negotiations are over.

1230
01:31:43,128 --> 01:31:47,966
Well, negotiations are never over anytime.

1231
01:31:48,050 --> 01:31:48,967
You know, it…

1232
01:31:49,801 --> 01:31:51,720
actually reminds me of this one time
I was…

1233
01:31:53,639 --> 01:31:56,266
I was selling missiles to a arms dealer,

1234
01:31:56,350 --> 01:31:59,353
and he was haggling and haggling,
wouldn't stop.

1235
01:31:59,436 --> 01:32:01,855
Finally, he bought the missiles and…

1236
01:32:03,774 --> 01:32:05,734
And he comes back an hour later,
and he says,

1237
01:32:05,817 --> 01:32:08,320
"I paid too much for these missiles.
I want a better price," you know.

1238
01:32:08,403 --> 01:32:10,906
And I said, "That's not how this works.
You can't haggle now."

1239
01:32:10,989 --> 01:32:14,201
He says, "I want a full refund.
I don't even want the missiles anymore."

1240
01:32:14,284 --> 01:32:17,037
I said to him, "Look,
I can't take these missiles back.

1241
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:19,206
-You've had them for an hour."
-Enough!

1242
01:32:20,374 --> 01:32:22,459
The passcode now!

1243
01:32:23,210 --> 01:32:24,753
Or you both die.

1244
01:32:27,005 --> 01:32:28,423
He gets very upset.

1245
01:32:29,883 --> 01:32:31,260
Do you have the passcode?

1246
01:32:33,387 --> 01:32:35,097
Do you have the passcode or not?

1247
01:32:35,597 --> 01:32:39,059
'Cause it is going to be very painful
for both of us if you do not.

1248
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:41,270
My friend?

1249
01:33:11,049 --> 01:33:12,384
I'm sorry I'm late.

1250
01:33:18,807 --> 01:33:19,933
Glad you could make it.

1251
01:33:20,517 --> 01:33:24,021
Well, what can I say?
You might be growing on me.

1252
01:33:25,647 --> 01:33:26,815
What is this?

1253
01:33:27,399 --> 01:33:30,235
An opportunity for me to check out
all the players.

1254
01:33:30,319 --> 01:33:33,322
Mr. Utami, since you're the one
with the money, I'll address you.

1255
01:33:33,822 --> 01:33:36,909
The price of the passcode
is exactly half of Leveque's fee.

1256
01:33:38,327 --> 01:33:43,290
Wire it to this account
after that case opens.

1257
01:33:43,790 --> 01:33:45,626
You are the Taxman.

1258
01:33:46,210 --> 01:33:47,544
Here to collect.

1259
01:33:53,091 --> 01:33:55,761
In that case, then who are you?

1260
01:33:55,844 --> 01:33:56,887
My boyfriend.

1261
01:33:58,972 --> 01:34:00,057
Damn straight.

1262
01:34:00,974 --> 01:34:03,310
If you have the passcode,
I accept your terms.

1263
01:34:03,393 --> 01:34:05,312
-Mr. Utami--
-Open it.

1264
01:34:08,190 --> 01:34:09,775
You have the passcode?

1265
01:34:09,858 --> 01:34:11,693
I still have friends at the agency.

1266
01:34:13,278 --> 01:34:14,446
Wait a minute. You can't open that.

1267
01:34:14,530 --> 01:34:17,783
When the people you love are in danger,
you do whatever it takes.

1268
01:34:47,396 --> 01:34:48,272
Voilà.

1269
01:34:49,481 --> 01:34:51,900
Aztec, as promised.

1270
01:34:54,820 --> 01:34:56,029
Thank you very much.

1271
01:35:04,872 --> 01:35:06,748
It's a pleasure doing business with you.

1272
01:35:06,832 --> 01:35:08,375
Yes, thank you very much.

1273
01:35:09,001 --> 01:35:13,839
However, my business is not yet finished,
but you are.

1274
01:35:13,922 --> 01:35:17,801
What makes you think I will let you two
out of here alive?

1275
01:35:18,385 --> 01:35:22,139
The ten-million-dollar bounty
I put on your head might help.

1276
01:35:24,349 --> 01:35:27,728
I don't know
how many bounty hunters are here,

1277
01:35:27,811 --> 01:35:29,855
but they definitely know about you.

1278
01:35:32,649 --> 01:35:34,151
Know what's funny?

1279
01:35:34,651 --> 01:35:38,906
Like you, I didn't actually have
the money until just now,

1280
01:35:38,989 --> 01:35:41,116
but the bounty hunters
didn't need to know that.

1281
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:42,618
They just needed to know where you were.

1282
01:35:42,701 --> 01:35:45,120
Okay, Leveque.
You're worth a lot of money.

1283
01:35:45,204 --> 01:35:48,081
-I'll take that from you.
-Gun!

1284
01:35:48,624 --> 01:35:51,877
Nobody move!

1285
01:35:53,879 --> 01:35:56,131
You are so dead, my friend.

1286
01:35:56,215 --> 01:35:59,134
Tell your guys not to do anything stupid.

1287
01:36:23,242 --> 01:36:26,036
And what is the plan, huh?
Now what are you going to do?

1288
01:36:26,912 --> 01:36:28,789
Do nothing. You're coming with me.

1289
01:36:28,872 --> 01:36:30,791
How can I do nothing and come with you?

1290
01:36:30,874 --> 01:36:33,418
You idiot,
how are you going to get out of here?

1291
01:36:33,502 --> 01:36:38,173
I'll give you 20 million to shoot
this one. To kill her right now.

1292
01:36:50,644 --> 01:36:51,812
Are you ready?

1293
01:36:51,895 --> 01:36:54,147
Ready for what?
No, I'm not. I'm definitely not. What--

1294
01:37:31,143 --> 01:37:34,980
You flush them forward.
I will cut around. Get the vial. Now! Go!

1295
01:37:37,983 --> 01:37:38,984
Stairs.

1296
01:38:04,635 --> 01:38:05,844
Where you going?

1297
01:38:22,653 --> 01:38:23,946
Sadie?

1298
01:38:24,029 --> 01:38:25,322
I'm an ally.

1299
01:38:26,031 --> 01:38:28,408
-Jonas?
-I have missed you so much.

1300
01:38:29,368 --> 01:38:31,495
Listen, it was never gonna
work out between us.

1301
01:38:31,578 --> 01:38:33,914
No, no, no, no. Of course it wasn't.
I was losing too many body parts.

1302
01:38:33,997 --> 01:38:35,958
That's not sustainable.
But if you look on the bright side,

1303
01:38:36,041 --> 01:38:37,292
I still have 20 vision.

1304
01:38:40,212 --> 01:38:41,922
Jonas,
I'm in the middle of something here.

1305
01:38:42,005 --> 01:38:44,925
I know. Look, losing the eye sucked.

1306
01:38:45,008 --> 01:38:47,010
But I'll tell you,
getting this thing blown off,

1307
01:38:47,094 --> 01:38:48,846
that was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1308
01:38:48,929 --> 01:38:53,100
Seriously, it changed my whole life.
I'm a good, solid, active listener now.

1309
01:38:54,518 --> 01:38:55,811
That's the other ear.

1310
01:38:55,894 --> 01:38:58,522
I didn't need the ear.
You keep going. You do what you do.

1311
01:39:05,487 --> 01:39:06,780
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1312
01:39:09,157 --> 01:39:11,618
All right, yes.
That looked cool, but cheating.

1313
01:39:11,702 --> 01:39:15,122
You're not the Taxman.
Who the hell are you?

1314
01:39:15,205 --> 01:39:16,206
What she said.

1315
01:39:17,499 --> 01:39:18,959
I'm the boyfriend.

1316
01:39:39,605 --> 01:39:41,064
No!

1317
01:39:51,867 --> 01:39:53,160
You need to get me out.

1318
01:39:53,243 --> 01:39:54,703
No, you stay here.

1319
01:40:20,979 --> 01:40:22,231
Give me the weapon.

1320
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:36,119
Damn it.

1321
01:40:36,203 --> 01:40:38,956
Come on, Taxman. Give me my weapon.

1322
01:41:12,656 --> 01:41:14,575
You should be ashamed of yourself.

1323
01:41:16,159 --> 01:41:18,161
Squandering all this talent.

1324
01:41:18,996 --> 01:41:22,374
-You and I could've had so much working--
-There's nothing you have that I want.

1325
01:41:42,477 --> 01:41:46,523
What is it that you want, huh?
You want a boyfriend? So pedestrian.

1326
01:41:47,691 --> 01:41:50,652
He does not know you.
He does not see the real you.

1327
01:42:02,164 --> 01:42:03,582
Cole?

1328
01:42:07,503 --> 01:42:08,545
Cole!

1329
01:42:42,871 --> 01:42:44,331
Get me over there!

1330
01:43:07,479 --> 01:43:09,273
You look amazing in that dress.

1331
01:43:10,607 --> 01:43:12,609
And you should wear more suits.

1332
01:43:36,383 --> 01:43:40,554
-He almost died in a refrigerator.
-But I did not do that. That was his.

1333
01:43:40,637 --> 01:43:42,973
-In a refrigerator, for how long?
-Was it you?

1334
01:43:43,056 --> 01:43:45,350
-Why would I put a cat in a fridge?
-What are you talking about?

1335
01:43:45,434 --> 01:43:47,186
-You didn't put him in.
-I think it's pretty clear.

1336
01:43:47,269 --> 01:43:50,189
-You didn't notice him when you closed it.
-Not the cat story.

1337
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:53,275
-He did it.
-Yeah, the cat story again.

1338
01:43:53,358 --> 01:43:56,862
So, Europe by rail.
That sounds so romantic.

1339
01:43:56,945 --> 01:43:58,739
You want to write a book,
you got to do research.

1340
01:43:58,822 --> 01:44:00,407
What's Sadie supposed to do
in all these places

1341
01:44:00,490 --> 01:44:02,284
while you're reading musty old scrolls
about farming?

1342
01:44:02,367 --> 01:44:06,163
Don't worry about me. I have a whole list
of clients I need to hunt down.

1343
01:44:06,747 --> 01:44:08,290
I'm sure you're gonna get them all, dear.

1344
01:44:08,373 --> 01:44:09,249
I know I will.

1345
01:44:09,333 --> 01:44:10,417
Yeah, she will.

1346
01:44:10,501 --> 01:44:12,586
Art curating is so much more exciting
than I imagined.

1347
01:44:12,669 --> 01:44:14,963
-Yeah
-Yeah. God, like, I want to be you.

1348
01:44:15,047 --> 01:44:17,424
I mean, except the part where
you're sleeping with my brother.

1349
01:44:17,508 --> 01:44:18,550
What?

1350
01:44:18,634 --> 01:44:20,177
Just, please.

1351
01:44:20,260 --> 01:44:21,512
-So…
-We're at the dinner table.

1352
01:44:21,595 --> 01:44:23,764
You guys promise to take care
of this little guy while we're gone?

1353
01:44:23,847 --> 01:44:25,307
Yes, I love succulents.

1354
01:44:25,390 --> 01:44:28,685
-How hard is it to keep a cactus alive?
-Sometimes harder than you think.

1355
01:44:28,769 --> 01:44:31,688
-But worth it.
-Very much.

1356
01:44:33,273 --> 01:44:35,234
I mean, we're talking about a cactus.
Right?

1357
01:44:35,317 --> 01:44:36,610
You water it once a month.

1358
01:44:36,693 --> 01:44:38,820
-Or are we talking-- Okay. It's subtext.
-Okay.

1359
01:44:38,904 --> 01:44:40,447
-That's right.
-There's a--

1360
01:44:40,531 --> 01:44:42,282
-There's a hidden meaning.
-Yep. There's-- And then--

1361
01:44:42,366 --> 01:44:43,742
-Levels.
-Okay, that's great.

1362
01:44:43,825 --> 01:44:46,495
-Your mother and I have a--
-There's no "mother and I" story.

1363
01:44:46,578 --> 01:44:48,872
-It's not about a cactus.
-No, it is not.

1364
01:44:48,956 --> 01:44:50,165
It involves wrestling.

1365
01:44:51,416 --> 01:44:54,962
Did he ever tell you that he wrestled
in high school?

1366
01:44:55,045 --> 01:44:56,713
Keep drinking your wine.

1367
01:44:56,797 --> 01:44:58,173
Okay.

1368
01:45:11,395 --> 01:45:15,649
-Hey, babe, I'm sorry I'm late.
-Nice car.

1369
01:45:16,608 --> 01:45:19,736
Are you sure the CIA didn't let you
keep Utami's money after all?

1370
01:45:19,820 --> 01:45:22,322
You wish. I'm borrowing this.

1371
01:45:22,406 --> 01:45:24,449
How was your meeting
with Professor Kirkland?

1372
01:45:24,533 --> 01:45:25,868
-Really good.
-Yeah?

1373
01:45:25,951 --> 01:45:27,661
He gave me some amazing research.

1374
01:45:29,329 --> 01:45:30,455
This is Raul.

1375
01:45:30,539 --> 01:45:31,957
He's an arms dealer,

1376
01:45:32,833 --> 01:45:34,668
but business stays in the car.

1377
01:45:37,713 --> 01:45:38,589
Date night.

1378
01:45:43,385 --> 01:45:44,261
Us time.

1379
01:45:46,972 --> 01:45:47,973
Us time.
