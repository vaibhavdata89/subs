1
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,163
Stop, police!

2
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,166
Stop that girl!

3
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:44,601
Excuse me!

4
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:47,559
- Terribly sorry.
- Oi!

5
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:50,083
Watch where you're sodding going!

6
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:53,125
Stop her!

7
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:10,541
Perhaps I should explain.

8
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,958
<i>My name is Enola Holmes.</i>

9
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:16,666
<i>You may remember me.</i>

10
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,333
<i>After solving my first case...</i>

11
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:21,583
Hello.

12
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:23,958
<i>...I started a business.</i>

13
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:26,833
<i>A detective agency.</i>

14
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:31,375
<i>Open and ready for my first clients.</i>

15
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,583
<i>I was going to join the pantheon
of great Victorian detectives.</i>

16
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:37,476
<i>- Detective Field.
- Yes.</i>

17
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,892
<i>- Mackenzie Macintosh.
- Hi.</i>

18
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:40,636
<i>- Sir Alfred Hornblower.
- Tally-ho!</i>

19
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:44,166
<i>And the infamous Reginald Swain.</i>

20
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,541
<i>And best of all,
I would be joining my brother.</i>

21
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:48,791
<i>I would be his equal.</i>

22
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:52,666
<i>A detective in my own right,</i>

23
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:55,666
<i>worthy of the Holmes name.</i>

24
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,458
Congratulations.

25
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,583
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

26
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:11,166
Am I addressing the secretary?

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,708
You're how old?

28
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:16,391
- Stone the crows, you're young.
- My age is an advantage.

29
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:20,208
I can go to places others can't,
explore where others won't.

30
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,375
And I can fight. I know jujitsu.

31
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:28,125
But you're a girl.

32
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,000
Yes, I am. Um...

33
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,208
What experience have you had?

34
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:38,000
- The Tewkesbury case?
- Well, that was Sherlock Holmes.

35
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,226
- That was Sherlock...
- Sherlock...

36
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:43,083
- Sherlock Holmes, wasn't it?
- I assure you, it was mine.

37
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:46,083
Good man, that Tewkesbury. Brave lad.

38
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,166
- Tell me...
- Tell me...

39
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,125
- Tell me...
- Yes?

40
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,375
Might your brother be free?

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,833
Read all about it! Read all about it!

42
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:59,708
Sherlock Holmes
and the case of the Brixton corpse.

43
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:01,208
<i>So, my brother.</i>

44
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:05,875
<i>While I had not a single case,
Sherlock has been drowning in them.</i>

45
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,875
<i>Though his latest
appears to be vexing him.</i>

46
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,916
<i>My mother, meanwhile, is still on the run.</i>

47
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:20,208
<i>And trying not to draw
attention to herself.</i>

48
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,916
<i>Though that's never
been her forte.</i>

49
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:45,666
<i>Yes, and then there is... him.</i>

50
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,291
My lords,
reform is not a task to be accomplished,

51
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,958
nor a bill that can be passed.

52
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,083
Rather it is a constant need for change.

53
00:03:56,583 --> 00:04:01,250
<i>Lord Tewkesbury,
the champion of change and progress.</i>

54
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,375
<i>A man to approach with the noblest cause.</i>

55
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:10,458
<i>♪ Till we have built Jerusalem ♪</i>

56
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,041
<i>But I had no time
for distractions.</i>

57
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,416
<i>And besides, he's still a nincompoop.</i>

58
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,833
Too many people
make it their sole purpose in life

59
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,250
to fit into the world around them.

60
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,666
This is a mistake.

61
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,750
It's your path, Enola.

62
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,333
<i>Sometimes, you'll stumble.</i>

63
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,916
<i>Sometimes, you'll fall.</i>

64
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,708
<i>But no matter how lost you feel,</i>

65
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,166
<i>if you stay true to yourself,</i>

66
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,708
<i>the path will always find you again.</i>

67
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,708
<i>But my path, it seemed,
had come to an end.</i>

68
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,250
<i>I was a failure.</i>

69
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,250
<i>All I could do now was go home.</i>

70
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,750
Enola Holmes?

71
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,333
Yes?

72
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,416
I've come to the right place then.

73
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,500
Is it true you find lost people?

74
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,083
Where did you get this?

75
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,750
It's months old.

76
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,583
I found it on the street.

77
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:45,916
Who have you lost?

78
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:49,583
My sister.

79
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:05,625
Watch the gap.

80
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,500
She disappeared a week ago.

81
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,083
Everyone says she's run away,
but Sarah wouldn't do that,

82
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,166
not to me.

83
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,750
She's my only family now.

84
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,166
This way.

85
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,500
The other girls are still at work.

86
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,750
Tea?

87
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:39,833
Thank you.

88
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:42,875
Might I see her bedroom?

89
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,625
Ours, you mean?

90
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,291
You're standing in it.

91
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:53,125
We're lucky.
Most girls here are five to a room.

92
00:06:58,875 --> 00:06:59,875
This might help.

93
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,458
Oh. Sarah likes
to leave cheese out for 'em.

94
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,208
She's soft.

95
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,750
What does she look like, Sarah?

96
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,458
About this tall.

97
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,291
Pretty.

98
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:19,500
Very pretty.

99
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:22,541
Green eyes, red hair, freckles...

100
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:23,875
Red hair?

101
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,666
We weren't sisters in the usual way.

102
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,250
Found sisters.

103
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,041
Sarah took her in.

104
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,291
Who's this, Bess?

105
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,208
- Enola Holmes.
- She's a detective.

106
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,291
She looks like
she'll blow over in the wind.

107
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,375
Mae!

108
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:45,416
So, Bessie, what was Sarah wearing
the day she disappeared?

109
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,208
- What's she doing?
- Shh.

110
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,083
She's wasting her time.

111
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,250
It was her other dress, the green one.

112
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,458
Does she like reading?

113
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,583
Oh yes. She taught herself.

114
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:03,375
Sarah said you had to learn about
the world if you're gonna live in it.

115
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,750
Makeup.

116
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,250
Did she have a suitor?

117
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,208
Nah. But there's plenty
have taken an interest.

118
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,916
She weren't much of a gardener.

119
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,958
Look, how about you quit sniffing round?

120
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,250
Quiet, Mae!
Just let her do her job.

121
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:47,208
The 12th of March.
Does that date mean anything to you?

122
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,291
That's enough.

123
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,833
We don't need help from people like you.

124
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,708
I found her, so she's staying.

125
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,941
Bloody girls poking their nose in.

126
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,916
- And she didn't leave a note?
- Just this.

127
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,916
She worked two jobs, you see.
We couldn't get by without it.

128
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,708
Washed glasses at a pub.

129
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,333
Some place called The Stag Antlers.

130
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,500
You can have it.

131
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:22,416
Oh. No, it's all right.
We'll figure that out later.

132
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,916
So tell me,
when was the last time you saw her?

133
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,208
A week ago, at the match factory.

134
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:32,916
She had a fight with Mr. Crouch,
the foreman, in his office.

135
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,208
- What about?
- He said she was thieving.

136
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,916
But Sarah's honest.

137
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,958
The match factory,
is that where she works?

138
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:43,291
Where we all work.
We're match girls, ain't we?

139
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,416
- Then that's where we'll start.
- So you'll take it? You'll take the case?

140
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,875
Thank you, Miss Holmes.

141
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:56,416
Thank you.

142
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,333
<i>At last, my first case.</i>

143
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,791
<i>Well, actually, my second.</i>

144
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,208
<i>I shall find you, Sarah Chapman.</i>

145
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:08,375
<i>Red hair, green dress,
makeup, science books, 12th March.</i>

146
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,833
<i>Whatever you've been up to...</i>

147
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,625
<i>...the game is afoot.</i>

148
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,916
Stay with me. Follow my way.

149
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,083
- How many girls work here?
- Five hundred, maybe six.

150
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,583
How do I look?

151
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,791
- Is my neckerchief all right?
- Oh, well, it's around your neck.

152
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:30,833
Morning, Bessie.

153
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:31,916
Morning, Doris.

154
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,458
<i>Mouth.</i>

155
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,666
Mouth.

156
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,250
- Mouth.
- Come on.

157
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,666
- Next.
- Out.

158
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,791
- Please, Mr. Crouch.
- I said, out.

159
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,833
- Mouth.
- What are you looking at?

160
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:55,166
Oi, new girl.
Name in the register.

161
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Mouth.

162
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,916
- What are you looking for?
- Typhus.

163
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,541
That's the phosphorus.

164
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,666
Don't worry, you get used to the smell.

165
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,458
Is this where she worked?

166
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,875
Put the matches on the comb...

167
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,291
slide 'em along,

168
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,541
up and into the box.

169
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,250
Simple enough.

170
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,416
You try.

171
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,333
That is a penny off your wages.

172
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:04,250
She's just learning the way,
Mr. Crouch.

173
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:07,166
She better learn quicker,
or it's a penny off yours too.

174
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,833
Anyone else want a money dock?

175
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:11,833
How about you, eh?

176
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,083
No, didn't think so.

177
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,458
Right, back to work.

178
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,041
I need to get up into that office.

179
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:28,958
Not a hope.

180
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:43,875
No talking.

181
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,083
<i>All it takes is one small thing</i>

182
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,583
to change the rules of the world.

183
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,291
Oi. Faster fingers, faster fingers.

184
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Hurrah!

185
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,250
How did that bloody happen, eh?

186
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:23,750
Well, pick 'em up.

187
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,541
Oi, pick 'em up.

188
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,416
Pick 'em up, pick 'em up.

189
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,916
Right! Back to work.

190
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,083
Why were you here?

191
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,333
Come on, girls.

192
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,958
Red.

193
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,333
Time's a-wasting.

194
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,333
Don't you look at me like that, girl.

195
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,958
Oi, stop talking!

196
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:18,000
Green eyes, red hair.

197
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,708
So you did steal something.

198
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:30,041
Charles! This is not what I was
expecting when we made our arrangement.

199
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,875
This is blatant extortion.

200
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:32,958
Criminal!

201
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,250
- My pockets are empty.
- You think mine full?

202
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,458
You gave me your word you'd find
whoever was doing this to us.

203
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,541
You sound almost threatening, Mr. Lyon.

204
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,791
This is not what I expected
when we began our arrangement.

205
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,125
And now theft, on top of everything else.

206
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:52,708
- You heard the man. Get this dealt with.
- Come along, William.

207
00:14:56,916 --> 00:15:00,375
Sir, do you have any suspicions
as to who this perpetrator might be?

208
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,541
Would I be asking you if I did?

209
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:09,750
But, sir, perhaps if we were to consider
whether this theft is connected.

210
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,416
- I have ideas...
- Did I ask for your advice?

211
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,125
Or did I simply tell you to get it done?

212
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,000
I'll make sure the right people know, sir.

213
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,333
Miss Troy!

214
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:26,875
Yes, sir.

215
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,500
Our ladies are working at the highest
level of production and efficiency.

216
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,208
- Are they not, William?
- Yes, Father.

217
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,666
Please, if you will...

218
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,333
Doris, how are you? How's your sister?
Is she, um, still unwell?

219
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,000
Uh, yes, Mr. Lyon.

220
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:44,708
Typhus.

221
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,750
Really is the plague of our time.

222
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,333
Two years it's been killing these girls.

223
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,458
Breaks my heart.

224
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:59,250
Well, Lord McIntyre, if I might suggest
a little lunch. I think we've earned it.

225
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,500
How did Sarah do it?
Get into the office?

226
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:10,291
There was a fire at one of the stations.
Foreman got distracted.

227
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:13,708
Whose station?

228
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,375
Mae's?

229
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,791
Yes.

230
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,333
You're a good detective, Enola Holmes.

231
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,791
Everyone thinks detecting
is a profession littered with rules,

232
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,125
but in truth, there's only one.

233
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:38,916
Pull on every loose thread you find.

234
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,958
She's a loose thread.

235
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,583
So I'm pulling at her.

236
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:54,958
- Oh.
- Hello, sir.

237
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,833
- What a pleasant evening.
- Young lady, I'm afraid I'm married.

238
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:21,708
Hello, dearie. Forgot your ticket?

239
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:25,250
That's tuppence for a sweet,
cheating face like yours.

240
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:26,916
Ha'penny a piece.

241
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,375
- Genuine toffee.
- Out of my way, girl.

242
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,791
Ha'penny a piece.

243
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,333
<i>Where are you, Mae?</i>

244
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,250
Excuse me, sir.

245
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,958
I've never seen anything like it!

246
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,583
And here she comes!

247
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,875
One, two,
a-one, two, three four.

248
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,916
<i>♪ Where did you get that hat?
Where did you get that tile? ♪</i>

249
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,500

257
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,458
And now, all the way from Shanghai,

258
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:53,416
Mr. Li and his world of illusions!

259
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,500
My next trick...

260
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,916
You the foozler who took my pan stick?

261
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:09,208
Um, no. I'm looking for a girl called M...

262
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,291
Uh...

263
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,083
Hm.

264
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,875
She worked two jobs, you see.

265
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,875
Some place called The Stag Antlers.

266
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,583
<i>♪ Where'er I go, they shout
"Hello, where did you get that hat?" ♪</i>

267
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,083
You got five seconds
to tell me why you're here.

268
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,666
Did Sarah work here?

269
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,250
She did, didn't she?
And Bessie doesn't know.

270
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,708
There's plenty Bessie don't know.
And plenty you don't need to tell her.

271
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:54,625
I know you helped her into that office.
She took those pages. Why?

272
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,416
- What's happened to her?
- Just leave us be, all right?

273
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,083
Posh girls like you
don't belong in this fight.

274
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,916
Posh or not,
one thing I am good at is fighting.

275
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,458
Now tell me, where is she hiding
and what does she know?

276
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,875
You got more to you than I thought.

277
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,583
Whatever this is,
Mae is on stage in 30 ticks,

278
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,416
and she's still dressed as a gent.

279
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,708
So let go of her, now.

280
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,041
- Get her out of here.
- Be my pleasure.

281
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,708
Come on.

282
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,916
Where did Sarah Chapman do her makeup?

283
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:44,000
Full of secrets that one,
and not a bad actress.

284
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,291
I'd have given her the boot
if she weren't so good,

285
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,625
but she did attract the men
with big pockets.

286
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,250
Always useful that. Shift it.

287
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,208
Which men?

288
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:01,083
There was this one gent, society type,
and he came regular.

289
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:06,500
Very keen on him she was.
He'd send flowers, letters.

290
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,083
His name?

291
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,583
Never gave one.

292
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:22,541
You see, they all think there's
hope. That love is coming their way.

293
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,000
But it never is.

294
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,250
Blokes like that, they want cheap,

295
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,375
but they marry dear.

296
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,500
<i>"As we two ate of the fruit of love..."</i>

297
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,083
The fruit of love? Ugh.

298
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,666
<i>"A bell did ring in the sky above"</i>

299
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,750
<i>"So wander that place
With its blossoms white"</i>

300
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,833
<i>"A chapel awaits us out of sight"</i>

301
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:48,791
And a poppy.

302
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,500
Is that his name?

303
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:53,958
<i>Why did she leave?</i>

304
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,833
<i>Did she run away with this fellow?</i>

305
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,875
<i>Or is she running from him?</i>

306
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,916
I hope it's the latter.
His poetry is extremely bad.

307
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:02,541
Be away with you, boy.

308
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,083
All right.

309
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:10,250
- Sherlock?
- Enola.

310
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,625
What are you doing here? It's not safe.

311
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,333
There are scary people about.

312
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:19,141
Yes, let me know when you meet one.

313
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:22,208
- Brother, are you quite yourself?
- I'm fine.

314
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:25,833
It was just a disagreement
over a glass of wine

315
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:27,583
and whose wine it was.

316
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:28,666
And, uh...

317
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:33,833
I find after wine, it's very difficult
to make your arms and legs move.

318
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:34,916
Let's get you home.

319
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:40,000
I don't usually imbibe,
but I'm on a case, you see.

320
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,708
- It's proven rather tricky.
- Cab.

321
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:44,208
- Hello.
- Hello.

322
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:47,166
- Where are we going?
- 221 Baker Street.

323
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:56,416
<i>As it turns out,
my brother is medievally heavy.</i>

324
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:01,250
It's like carrying a dead horse
on which sits another dead horse.

325
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,916
That's A, and I'm B.

326
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,916
I didn't know you had steps.

327
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,500
One should always have steps
to avoid people stepping on you.

328
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:17,708
That's a tip.
You should probably write that down.

329
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:20,541
All right. Lift your right leg.

330
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:22,333
Mm-hmm.

331
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:24,875
Now your left.

332
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:28,833
Better leg, the left.
You should write that down.

333
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:32,708
Here we go.

334
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,875
Ha! Home. Well done, Sherlock.

335
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:40,125
I can do it.

336
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:44,666
See?

337
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:51,541
Baker Street.

338
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:02,541
- Oh, but it's such a mess.
- It's perfect. Don't touch anything.

339
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:04,458
What are you investigating?

340
00:25:04,541 --> 00:25:06,941
None of your business.
I work alone. It's private.

341
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:09,291
Now shh, I'm thinking.

342
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:11,875
One should never be interrupted
when thinking.

343
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:15,125
- Oh. You should...
- Write that down?

344
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:19,041
Shh!

345
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,166
Don't go in there.

346
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,333
No.

347
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:40,000
Sherlock's latest case.

348
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:49,458
Fascinating.

349
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:56,000
And why, pray, have you moved everything?

350
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:03,833
- Nothing looks different to me.
- Nothing looks different? Ev...

351
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,125
Your head is sore? I can't think why.

352
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:09,916
This is why
I don't have people in my rooms.

353
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:14,250
Look what you've done.
My papers are entirely out of order.

354
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,583
Your case, it's vexing you.

355
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:21,708
Seems to be an awful lot of question marks
on that map of yours.

356
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:23,708
Dundee cake. Door.

357
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:26,125
- I will see you again.
<i>- </i>Is that why you're drinking?

358
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:29,041
I'm more than certain...
...it's not so old.

359
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:31,416
- Maybe I can help.
- You can help by leaving.

360
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:35,958
Huh. Yes. The world
will be a much safer place

361
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:39,208
if we don't see the inside
of Sherlock Holmes, only the out.

362
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:42,208
Crazy idea.

363
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:45,208
Have you ever considered a flatmate?

364
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:48,041
- For what purpose?
- To stop you descending into this.

365
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:53,375
Strange

366
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:58,250
how those seeking advice
so often like to dispense it.

367
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:01,041
Did I ask for advice?
I found you on the street, drunk.

368
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:04,333
- Now what may I observe about you?
- We're not playing this game.

369
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:05,936
Shoes a state. Hair's not much better.

370
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
- You and Mycroft are so similar.
- You need to wash your clothes.

371
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:11,208
- Unwilling to look past...
- You are pale...

372
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:14,208
- Stop!
- And then there's your fingernails.

373
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:17,666
- Why are you working in a match factory?
- What?

374
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:21,416
Last night, they were dirty with green
traces. This morning, they are black.

375
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,041
The phosphorous from the match-making
has mixed with oxygen.

376
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:27,041
I wasn't in such a state
as to not see that.

377
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:29,642
- How did you...
- And your neck is red.

378
00:27:29,666 --> 00:27:31,586
Someone has gripped it
or held a knife against...

379
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,100
Are you involved in something dangerous?

380
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,250
You are still my ward.

381
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:44,041
If you need my help,
my offer remains on the table.

382
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:48,125
Don't be so desperate
to prove yourself, Enola.

383
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:54,083
I am not desperate,
and I don't need your or anyone's help.

384
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,625
But this I will have.

385
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:11,041
How dare he?
How dare he lecture me?

386
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:13,416
When he can't even solve his own case

387
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,666
and he lives in a bed of flummoxing papers
and bewildering mold.

388
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,375
How dare he claim I'm desperate?
It is not true.

389
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:21,750
- And this is not fair.
- Enola?

390
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,500
It is you.

391
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,375
And it is you.

392
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:33,041
How are you?

393
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,333
Are you well? You look...

394
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:40,708
I'm on a case. Undercover. Forget
I told you that piece of information.

395
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:44,625
It's the strangest thing. I could have
sworn I've seen you here before.

396
00:28:46,166 --> 00:28:47,166
Is that right?

397
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:50,250
Well, this is my...
My route through to the Lords.

398
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:53,458
Is it? How lovely.

399
00:28:53,541 --> 00:28:56,083
Well, I... I breakfast here on occasion.

400
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:03,750
I mean, yes, it's a lovely place.
I-I know the gardener here.

401
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:07,000
We've been discussing
what to sow for next year's crop.

402
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:08,416
Some fine sunflowers.

403
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,375
Uh, Sweet Williams,
for their lovely vivid reds.

404
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,000
I've seen all you're doing.

405
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:16,625
Oh. Well, it's... It's nothing.

406
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:18,041
In the society pages.

407
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:23,625
You are quite the eligible bachelor.

408
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,125
Don't believe all you read.

409
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:34,250
I wrote to you.

410
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:37,375
You didn't reply.

411
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:38,875
Uh...

412
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:41,583
I... was busy.

413
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:44,625
Starting my own business.
A perpetual challenge.

414
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:46,833
Perhaps, not something you'd understand.

415
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:50,041
- Well, Enola, if you need help...
- I do not.

416
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:54,583
Should my problem become horticultural,
I shall seek you out.

417
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:57,166
Right.

418
00:29:57,583 --> 00:30:00,250
Well, you know where to find me

419
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:03,500
should a plant go missing.

420
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:05,583
I hope you enjoy your breakfast.

421
00:30:09,916 --> 00:30:10,916
Yeah.

422
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,500
Is he looking back?

423
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:22,458
Oh. Good, he isn't.

424
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,250
I don't come here every day.

425
00:30:27,166 --> 00:30:28,791
Just on days when I feel a need.

426
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:33,833
And sometimes he doesn't take this path.
Sometimes he takes the parallel one.

427
00:30:36,916 --> 00:30:41,125
You know where to find me.

428
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,500
"You know where to find me."

429
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:50,125
<i>"Out of sight"</i>

430
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:53,583
<i>"The chapel awaits us
With its blossoms white"</i>

431
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:55,166
Whitechapel.

432
00:30:55,916 --> 00:30:57,666
<i>"As we two ate of the fruit of love"</i>

433
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,541
<i>"As we two ate..."</i>

434
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,916
"Two ate." Two-eight.

435
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Twenty-eight.

436
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:06,458
<i>"A bell did ring in the sky above"</i>

437
00:31:06,541 --> 00:31:07,625
Bell?

438
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:08,875
<i>"So wander that place"</i>

439
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:12,166
Bell. Place. <i>"Out of sight"</i>

440
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:17,083
28 Bell Place, Whitechapel!

441
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,333
Shh!

442
00:31:18,416 --> 00:31:20,041
Oh, sorry.

443
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,708
The game has found its feet again.

444
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:30,125
I will not lie.

445
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:33,041
There is a certain satisfaction
that you feel as a detective

446
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:35,750
when your case comes closer to resolution.

447
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:36,958
Like sewing a new skirt...

448
00:31:39,541 --> 00:31:42,416
...which I don't do,
or teaching a dog to sit.

449
00:31:43,416 --> 00:31:46,500
You begin to glow with the acknowledgement
of a job well done.

450
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:48,500
There's a new Holmes in town.

451
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:51,500
That's right. Sherlock Holmes
has met his match.

452
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:55,541
My name will be known,
and Bessie will have a sister once again.

453
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:58,083
And that is a job well...

454
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:01,791
done.

455
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:27,291
Sarah?

456
00:32:42,958 --> 00:32:44,541
What happened here?

457
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:56,333
Mr. Poppy.

458
00:33:06,958 --> 00:33:08,916
Oh, Mae.

459
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:13,791
What happened? Who did this to you?

460
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:17,750
Was it him, Sarah's man? Mae!

461
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,708
No, no. It's all right.

462
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:22,500
I'll fetch a doctor for you.

463
00:33:23,916 --> 00:33:25,541
No! No, no, no.

464
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:27,125
No.

465
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:28,458
Come back.

466
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:06,125
Miss Holmes?

467
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,750
Inspector Lestrade.

468
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:11,666
- Enola Holmes.
- Lestrade.

469
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,416
- She... She's...
- Dead.

470
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:15,958
How'd that happen?

471
00:34:20,583 --> 00:34:24,333
Oh, no, no, no. I'm investigating a case.
A disappearance of a girl.

472
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:27,458
- What, that girl?
- No. No, no, no. H-Her name is Mae.

473
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
She worked at the Paragon Theater,
the matchstick factory.

474
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:34,458
She was a dancer. She's friends...

475
00:34:48,791 --> 00:34:50,071
Superintendent Grail.

476
00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:57,958
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

477
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:00,541
I was sent to investigate
a possible disturbance.

478
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:03,791
Someone heard some screams,
and then I discovered this young lady.

479
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:04,916
Her name?

480
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,291
Enola Holmes.

481
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:08,958
Uh, his sister.

482
00:35:09,666 --> 00:35:10,708
A detective too.

483
00:35:10,791 --> 00:35:13,875
Good God, another one.

484
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:15,916
Shouldn't you be in finishing school?

485
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:19,500
Investigating the disappearance of a...

486
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:20,833
- Sarah Chapman.
- Yeah.

487
00:35:20,916 --> 00:35:24,458
Sarah Chapman?
Well, well, how intriguing. So am I.

488
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:27,625
- She's wanted for theft and blackmail.
- Blackmail?

489
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,375
Yes, detective.

490
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:33,958
Still warm. No rigor mortis.

491
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:37,666
- When were the screams heard, inspector?
- Ten past the hour, sir.

492
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,625
When did you arrive, detective?

493
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:42,333
A-Around the same time.

494
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:46,875
Even more intriguing.

495
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:51,333
Uh, no, I was trying to suppress
the blood. I-I was trying to save her.

496
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:53,666
Or trying to get information out of her.

497
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:56,875
Give her a search, inspector.

498
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:59,666
Oh, I couldn't. I can't pat her down, sir.

499
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:03,625
Come along, Lestrade.
Let's not be coy about this.

500
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:06,750
- She's a detective. She knows the rules.
- Yes.

501
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,125
Um...

502
00:36:11,208 --> 00:36:12,416
Give me that bag!

503
00:36:21,666 --> 00:36:22,666
What's this?

504
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:24,750
My evidence.

505
00:36:26,291 --> 00:36:27,208
And that?

506
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:31,208
It's nothing.

507
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:32,750
Then why are you hiding it?

508
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:37,041
Found at a murder scene
with a freshly dead corpse,

509
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:39,583
harboring evidence isn't gonna look good.

510
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:41,875
Superintendent Grail, you can't believe...

511
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:44,333
What can't I believe, missy?

512
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:47,625
That young ladies
don't have the hands for killing?

513
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:48,750
Now, give them here.

514
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:55,541
Oh!

515
00:37:05,916 --> 00:37:08,125
- Go on!
- After her, all of ya!

516
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,375
Why ever would she ever do that?

517
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:14,708
Get out of the way! Move!

518
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:16,708
Stop that girl!

519
00:37:19,416 --> 00:37:20,625
You've seen this before.

520
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:28,416
Ah. Lestrade of Scotland Yard.
You remember me, I hope.

521
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,958
We're looking for your sister.
She's caused a bit of trouble.

522
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:46,458
May I?

523
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,250
Is it, sir?

524
00:37:58,708 --> 00:37:59,875
Is it?

525
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:02,125
Take it. I have others.

526
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:03,958
Take it? I can't.

527
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:05,083
I can.

528
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:06,166
I can't.

529
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,000
Perhaps I can.

530
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:17,750
And this, the famous fiddle?

531
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:21,291
That I do not have two of.

532
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:25,416
Perhaps you can explain
what you believe Enola has done.

533
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,416
I wish I was at liberty to say, sir.

534
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,083
Do you mind?

535
00:38:41,041 --> 00:38:43,041
Oh, your latest case.

536
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:45,041
What's it concerning?

537
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,708
Is it another Brixton Strangler?

538
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:49,458
Or a Periwinkle?

539
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:52,458
Don't tell me it's a Clerkenwell.

540
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:54,416
What evidence do they have
against my sister?

541
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,166
Perhaps, uh, you tell me yours
and I'll tell you mine.

542
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:02,750
Government case, some missing money.

543
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:05,125
<i>Now you.</i>

544
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,416
<i>Super wants to talk her.</i>

545
00:39:08,208 --> 00:39:10,500
<i>- Why?</i>
- Just following orders, Mr. Holmes.

546
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:12,166
Or may I call you Sherlock?

547
00:39:14,416 --> 00:39:17,000
Graydon. Graydon Lestrade.

548
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:20,791
My father thought it distinguished,
and it is rather.

549
00:39:25,416 --> 00:39:28,708
Well, anyway, should you ever
wish to call me that...

550
00:39:30,208 --> 00:39:31,041
Right.

551
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:35,083
As you were.

552
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:47,041
Oh dear.

553
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:50,875
Whoa!

554
00:39:51,666 --> 00:39:54,333
My mistake.
I should have warned you I was opening it.

555
00:39:57,416 --> 00:39:58,416
No.

556
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Dare I ask?

557
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:12,875
Good afternoon.

558
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:15,208
May I ask a favor?

559
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:23,333
Never mind. Tell me everything.

560
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:25,708
- A government case?
- No.

561
00:40:26,916 --> 00:40:28,916
<i>Is it
another Brixton Strangler?</i>

562
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:32,125
Or... Or a Periwinkle?

563
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:34,875
"You tell me yours
and I'll tell you mine."

564
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:38,500
He's a ninny. I needed to know
what he had on you.

565
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:46,083
Money. Unaccounted transfers
going in and out of government offices.

566
00:40:46,833 --> 00:40:49,458
My theory is either bribery,
extortion, or blackmail.

567
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:50,875
And what have you found?

568
00:40:52,666 --> 00:40:54,750
Separate filings
from five different accounts

569
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:58,041
going via the Treasury
into one private bank.

570
00:40:58,125 --> 00:41:00,791
- So someone is getting rich from this?
- Yes.

571
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,041
- Who?
- No name.

572
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:05,541
Just a number.

573
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:08,583
I visited the bank and inquired.
The money disappeared,

574
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,833
arriving at another bank,
and then another,

575
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:13,083
and another, and another,
and another, and another.

576
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:16,833
Every one of them hidden
using different account numbers.

577
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:18,083
Twenty-seven in total.

578
00:41:18,166 --> 00:41:21,583
- Well, what can you deduce from that?
- Three things.

579
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:25,916
Firstly, the man's a game player,
perhaps a genius in mathematics,

580
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,083
capable of covering his traces
at every turn.

581
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:30,541
Secondly, the sources are varied.

582
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:33,958
Five banks, south of the river,
but no clear link between them.

583
00:41:34,541 --> 00:41:35,875
All anonymous.

584
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:39,125
All going into one pocket.

585
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:41,541
And the third?

586
00:41:44,791 --> 00:41:45,875
He knows I'm onto him.

587
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:48,250
What? How?

588
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:51,833
Every time I pull a thread,
it loosens, vanishes,

589
00:41:51,916 --> 00:41:54,625
reappears somewhere else.
He's leading me a merry dance.

590
00:41:54,708 --> 00:41:55,708
It's...

591
00:41:57,958 --> 00:41:58,958
It's infuriating.

592
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:02,083
So no leads whatsoever?

593
00:42:02,666 --> 00:42:04,416
One. A week before the first transfer,

594
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,180
there was a break-in
at the Treasury office

595
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,708
by a man in a taper crown hat.

596
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:08,916
A taper crown hat.

597
00:42:09,583 --> 00:42:10,875
- What was taken?
- A document.

598
00:42:10,958 --> 00:42:13,666
They won't talk about it.
Sensitive information presumably.

599
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:18,000
But how it connects to all of this
has so far eluded me.

600
00:42:18,541 --> 00:42:21,000
Your turn. I hope the blood's not yours.

601
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:24,500
I'm looking for a girl, Sarah Chapman.

602
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:27,041
Her sister employed me. Bessie.

603
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:31,458
She worked at Lyons match factory by day,
and the music hall at night.

604
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:33,375
She has a lover,

605
00:42:34,541 --> 00:42:36,291
whose flat I visited.

606
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,041
He'd given her this.

607
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:43,666
28 Bell Place?

608
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:46,458
Whitechapel, yes.

609
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:48,791
And there I found her friend,

610
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:51,083
murdered.

611
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:57,541
And who killed her? This poppy fellow?

612
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:03,041
I suspect so.

613
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:05,791
Perhaps he kidnapped Sarah
and her friend discovered it.

614
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:08,041
Love.

615
00:43:09,041 --> 00:43:10,250
What it does to people.

616
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:14,351
- How was she killed?
- A kitchen knife.

617
00:43:14,416 --> 00:43:15,875
- Did you touch this weapon?
- No.

618
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:18,833
Then why did you run?

619
00:43:18,916 --> 00:43:20,500
I found more evidence on her.

620
00:43:20,583 --> 00:43:22,416
This policeman wanted it.

621
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,333
- He has this walk.
- Grail.

622
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:27,250
We have a history.

623
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:30,375
This was in her pocket.

624
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:52,250
It's as bad as the poem.

625
00:43:54,041 --> 00:43:55,625
- Leave it with me.
- No.

626
00:43:56,125 --> 00:43:58,333
It's mine, and it's important.

627
00:43:59,666 --> 00:44:03,041
Grail said she had stolen something
and that she was blackmailing them.

628
00:44:03,666 --> 00:44:06,916
- Though Sarah wouldn't do that.
- You don't know this person.

629
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:09,083
I feel I do.

630
00:44:09,916 --> 00:44:11,958
You came here running from the police.

631
00:44:12,041 --> 00:44:13,791
Someone is already dead,

632
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:16,125
and you are now a suspect
in a murder case.

633
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:18,166
You've let your emotions
get the better of you.

634
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:21,583
Stay here. Don't leave.
I will look into this.

635
00:44:21,666 --> 00:44:25,541
But Sarah Chapman is my responsibility.
No one else cares for these girls.

636
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:27,666
I promised her sister.

637
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,541
The first mistake a detective makes

638
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:33,250
is to make it about themselves
and not the case.

639
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:43,416
Enola, I know you're not a fan
of unnecessary advice,

640
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,875
but please...

641
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:49,125
...don't turn into me.

642
00:44:53,875 --> 00:44:55,583
I should probably write that down.

643
00:44:56,916 --> 00:44:59,750
Matches, matches!
Come buy your matches!

644
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:01,083
Only a penny a box.

645
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:05,375
Matches, matches! Only a penny a box.

646
00:45:05,458 --> 00:45:06,916
Come buy your matches!

647
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,080
<i>Posh girls like you
don't belong in this fight.</i>

648
00:45:09,125 --> 00:45:11,125
We don't need help from people like you.

649
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:17,791
<i>See, they all think there's hope.
That love is coming their way.</i>

650
00:45:17,875 --> 00:45:19,125
But it never is.

651
00:45:20,291 --> 00:45:22,375
<i>Gents like that, they want cheap,</i>

652
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:23,958
<i>but they marry dear.</i>

653
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,583
<i>So, Poppy, you're a gent, are you?</i>

654
00:45:30,166 --> 00:45:33,333
<i>And a well-heeled one
to afford a love nest like that.</i>

655
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:37,500
- Sir...
- Don't be ridiculous.

656
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:26,291
<i>There was a break-in
at the Treasury office</i>

657
00:46:26,375 --> 00:46:27,875
<i>by a man in a taper crown hat.</i>

658
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:36,625
<i>Five banks, south of the river,
but no clear link between them.</i>

659
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,750
"Match makers ball."

660
00:46:44,583 --> 00:46:48,625
"Hosted by Henry and Hilda Lyon.
12 Marchmont Square."

661
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:51,958
Does that date mean anything to you?

662
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:55,583
It's not a date at all.

663
00:46:57,958 --> 00:47:01,166
"Their eldest son, William Lyon,
will be leading the first..."

664
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:04,541
Sweet Williams,
for their wonderfully vivid reds.

665
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:08,375
Our ladies are working at the highest
level of production and efficiency.

666
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:10,250
- Are they not, William?
- Yes, Father.

667
00:47:10,333 --> 00:47:13,833
And all along, I thought you were a poppy.

668
00:47:16,541 --> 00:47:19,666
Let's see how sweet you are,
Sweet William.

669
00:47:22,916 --> 00:47:23,916
I'm going to a ball.

670
00:47:26,958 --> 00:47:27,958
Ugh.

671
00:47:49,291 --> 00:47:50,291
'Tis I.

672
00:47:51,958 --> 00:47:53,250
'Tis not I.

673
00:47:54,083 --> 00:47:56,833
Which, when you're wanted
by the police, is most useful.

674
00:47:57,458 --> 00:48:00,875
Pray silence
for his Lordship Viscount McIntyre.

675
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:03,541
I-I'm sorry to break apart
this glorious occasion,

676
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:05,250
but, well, I'm a politician.

677
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:08,291
Any chance to stand on a stage,
I'll always take it.

678
00:48:09,458 --> 00:48:12,916
And I must speak
to thank our host

679
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,958
and applaud his achievements.

680
00:48:17,166 --> 00:48:18,625
No masks, no matter.

681
00:48:18,708 --> 00:48:22,416
For Henry Lyon
turns all before him into gold.

682
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,583
Ha, nonsense! Pewter at best.

683
00:48:25,666 --> 00:48:28,041
What he has done with matches
is legendary.

684
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:31,458
In two years, he's turned red into black.

685
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:32,916
Or should I say,

686
00:48:33,875 --> 00:48:36,208
red into white?

687
00:48:36,291 --> 00:48:38,541
And to have this humble man
turn his attention

688
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:40,666
to typhoid and the working poor,

689
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:44,166
raising funds,
diagnosing cases in the community,

690
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:46,416
I'm overwhelmed. I'm simply overwhelmed.

691
00:48:46,916 --> 00:48:51,041
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Henry Lyon.

692
00:48:51,125 --> 00:48:56,000
And to his fine son, his heir, William.

693
00:48:58,458 --> 00:48:59,541
To the future.

694
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:04,291
- To the future.
- May it ever be bright.

695
00:49:06,208 --> 00:49:08,041
Right, Henry, light us up.

696
00:49:09,625 --> 00:49:10,625
Gladly.

697
00:49:15,291 --> 00:49:17,250
Now go and enjoy yourselves.

698
00:49:23,833 --> 00:49:25,916
I believe I've seen that dress
somewhere before.

699
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,083
Oh yes, last year.

700
00:49:30,416 --> 00:49:32,333
I think it's charming, elegant.

701
00:49:32,958 --> 00:49:34,208
I think you are kind.

702
00:49:48,583 --> 00:49:49,666
Gentlemen.

703
00:49:50,541 --> 00:49:51,541
Ma'am.

704
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:53,250
Good evening.

705
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:58,750
This is a wonderful occasion, is it not?

706
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:07,041
I mean, the guests are just... delightful.

707
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:11,791
And the orchestra is most tuneful.

708
00:50:16,083 --> 00:50:18,125
I was wondering if

709
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:21,666
I might be able to speak to you, Mr. Lyon.

710
00:50:24,583 --> 00:50:27,500
- Uh, have I said something wrong?
- Where is your chaperone?

711
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:29,291
Chaperone?

712
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:33,708
My dear, you can hardly expect my son
to talk to you unaccompanied.

713
00:50:36,541 --> 00:50:38,083
Oh.

714
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:47,208
I cannot talk to you without a chaperone?

715
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:48,833
No, of course not.

716
00:50:48,916 --> 00:50:49,916
Honestly?

717
00:50:52,208 --> 00:50:53,208
Honestly?

718
00:50:54,083 --> 00:50:55,375
Who is this woman?

719
00:50:55,458 --> 00:50:57,125
Well, they are talking.

720
00:50:57,208 --> 00:50:58,458
They are dancing.

721
00:50:59,166 --> 00:51:00,875
Good evening, my dear.

722
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Yes.

723
00:51:03,083 --> 00:51:04,375
How foolish of me.

724
00:51:06,125 --> 00:51:07,125
Good evening.

725
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,875
It could be claimed,
with some justification,

726
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:27,750
that I might have prepared
more thoroughly.

727
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:30,000
But dancing is not
one of my core strengths.

728
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,291
Well, except...

729
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:36,125
<i>♪ Knees up Mother Brown
Under the table you must go ♪</i>

730
00:51:36,208 --> 00:51:37,708
<i>♪ Ee-aye, ee-aye, oh! ♪</i>

731
00:51:39,208 --> 00:51:40,750
You see my situation.

732
00:51:51,958 --> 00:51:53,125
Who are you?

733
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,400
<i>The man's a game player.</i>

734
00:51:57,458 --> 00:51:59,500
<i>Separate filings
from five different accounts.</i>

735
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:02,708
<i>Capable of covering his traces
at every turn. One private bank.</i>

736
00:52:02,791 --> 00:52:06,166
<i>Vanishes and reappears.
No name. Just a number.</i>

737
00:52:13,708 --> 00:52:15,666
<i>Perhaps
a genius in mathematics.</i>

738
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:19,083
Leading me a merry dance.

739
00:52:19,666 --> 00:52:20,541
It's a cipher.

740
00:52:26,375 --> 00:52:27,375
The polka.

741
00:52:28,708 --> 00:52:31,291
The promenade. The two-step.

742
00:52:32,208 --> 00:52:33,708
They're all dances.

743
00:52:33,791 --> 00:52:35,416
<i>Dance, dance, dance, dance.</i>

744
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,875
<i>Twenty-seven, turn on...</i>

745
00:52:42,375 --> 00:52:44,416
<i>Yes. </i>The Language of the Dance.

746
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,458
<i>"Twenty-seven dances."</i>

747
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:48,125
<i>I've got you.</i>

748
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:51,166
<i>Dance one, then 14.22.</i>

749
00:52:55,916 --> 00:52:58,625
Terrible, aren't they? These things.

750
00:52:59,583 --> 00:53:01,583
All pompidou and popinjay.

751
00:53:02,291 --> 00:53:03,750
Have we met somewhere before?

752
00:53:04,875 --> 00:53:08,166
I feel I recognize you from somewhere.

753
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:11,416
I simply have one of those faces.

754
00:53:13,875 --> 00:53:14,875
Mira Troy,

755
00:53:15,375 --> 00:53:17,291
private secretary to Lord McIntyre,

756
00:53:18,291 --> 00:53:19,333
Treasury Minister.

757
00:53:20,541 --> 00:53:21,541
Tabitha.

758
00:53:22,708 --> 00:53:24,250
Tabitha Timothy.

759
00:53:27,333 --> 00:53:29,166
You mustn't let them concern you.

760
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:31,250
It's just a performance.

761
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:34,375
Everyone here is playing a part.

762
00:53:35,166 --> 00:53:36,166
Testing each other.

763
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:39,916
Winning.

764
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:42,375
Losing.

765
00:53:43,541 --> 00:53:44,750
And it's fun,

766
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:47,125
once you know the rules.

767
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,500
What are they doing with those fans?

768
00:53:58,166 --> 00:53:59,666
Sending messages.

769
00:54:00,166 --> 00:54:03,416
Saying everything that is forbidden,

770
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:08,541
or too embarrassing to say aloud.

771
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,041
Thank you for the lesson.

772
00:54:16,708 --> 00:54:18,208
It's a lesson hard learned.

773
00:54:20,625 --> 00:54:24,166
Without power, we women
must rely on our wits for our fortune,

774
00:54:24,791 --> 00:54:27,375
because our chances are short. Here.

775
00:54:28,083 --> 00:54:29,083
Take my fan.

776
00:54:30,291 --> 00:54:31,583
I have no use for it.

777
00:54:33,083 --> 00:54:35,958
And if you wish to speak to William,

778
00:54:37,958 --> 00:54:39,541
you could always try with that.

779
00:54:57,166 --> 00:54:58,583
No, not... No, not you. Oh.

780
00:55:01,541 --> 00:55:02,541
Help.

781
00:55:05,083 --> 00:55:06,458
It would be my delight.

782
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,791
Really, there's no need to be rude.

783
00:55:12,875 --> 00:55:14,291
I-I didn't mean to.

784
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,291
Tewkesbury!

785
00:55:31,375 --> 00:55:33,791
- Your timing's impeccable!
- Enola?

786
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:36,791
Don't speak to me here, otherwise
you'll be thrown onto the street.

787
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:44,125
- I need you to teach me to dance.
- Teach you to dance? When?

788
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:46,250
- Teach me to dance now.
- Wh...

789
00:55:46,333 --> 00:55:48,541
You understand
I've been learning since I was five?

790
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:51,625
Good. I'd feared
you'd be a terrible teacher.

791
00:55:51,708 --> 00:55:54,375
- What are you doing here?
- I'm looking for a murderer.

792
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,416
Though I shouldn't have told you.
Forget I told you that.

793
00:55:57,916 --> 00:56:01,916
- I'm trying to save a girl's life.
- Through dance?

794
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,250
Please, Tewkesbury.

795
00:56:06,458 --> 00:56:09,083
All right. Hold your back straight.

796
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:14,125
And I'll place my hand here and here.

797
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:15,583
Oh. Yes.

798
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:17,916
Hold your arm out.

799
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:20,375
Good.

800
00:56:20,875 --> 00:56:22,958
Now, I will lead and you will follow.

801
00:56:23,041 --> 00:56:25,541
- That seems like a mistake.
- Face over my shoulder.

802
00:56:27,458 --> 00:56:30,500
And now, one, two, three.

803
00:56:31,041 --> 00:56:33,166
Two, three. Two, three.

804
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:36,208
Four, two, three. One, two, three.

805
00:56:36,708 --> 00:56:37,708
Two, three.

806
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:39,750
Good.

807
00:56:46,208 --> 00:56:48,333
You seem different since last we spoke.

808
00:56:49,541 --> 00:56:51,221
Tell me why you've been
coming to the park.

809
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:53,291
Why... Why watch me walk to the Lords?

810
00:56:54,125 --> 00:56:55,541
Simply keeping an eye on you,

811
00:56:56,041 --> 00:56:58,083
in case you get yourself
into any more scrapes.

812
00:56:58,166 --> 00:57:00,625
- Getting thrown out of trains.
- Enola...

813
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:02,875
You cannot be trusted
to take care of yourself.

814
00:57:03,583 --> 00:57:04,458
I'm a man now.

815
00:57:04,541 --> 00:57:06,250
You're a man when I tell you you're a man.

816
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:09,333
And the scrapes I find myself in
are far less visceral.

817
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:14,165
Now, come on.

818
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:18,708
Two, three. Two, three.

819
00:57:18,791 --> 00:57:19,916
Look into my eyes.

820
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,625
The rhythm is always there.

821
00:57:23,583 --> 00:57:25,541
Dancing is a trust, it's a union.

822
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:27,250
That's why I've always loved it,

823
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:29,958
even when I was being tutored by my uncle.

824
00:57:30,041 --> 00:57:31,750
That man likes a pork mustard pie.

825
00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:33,625
His breath...

826
00:57:34,166 --> 00:57:35,166
Turn, two.

827
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:37,833
Turn. Feel it?

828
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:39,583
I can feel it.

829
00:57:48,375 --> 00:57:49,375
Good.

830
00:57:50,416 --> 00:57:52,583
- You dance well.
- Perhaps I have a fine teacher.

831
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,875
Though his breath has less mustard
on it than I'd hoped.

832
00:58:18,291 --> 00:58:21,041
We have an urgent situation.

833
00:58:21,125 --> 00:58:22,125
I should go.

834
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:24,083
You'll need a dance card.

835
00:58:25,416 --> 00:58:26,875
But I don't know enough.

836
00:58:30,041 --> 00:58:31,791
- What does that mean?
- You'll learn.

837
00:58:36,458 --> 00:58:39,416
Don't touch the ginger cake.
Plays hopscotch with your bowels.

838
00:58:51,791 --> 00:58:52,791
Oh.

839
00:58:53,666 --> 00:58:54,666
Hello.

840
00:58:59,833 --> 00:59:02,416
- Mr. Lyon.
- Yes.

841
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:05,000
I was wondering
if we might have a dance this evening.

842
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,166
My dance card is full.

843
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:08,291
May I see it?

844
00:59:16,333 --> 00:59:18,000
Your last waltz is still free.

845
00:59:18,666 --> 00:59:19,791
How fitting.

846
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:22,875
Would you mind?

847
00:59:34,583 --> 00:59:35,583
Until then.

848
00:59:55,166 --> 00:59:56,166
'Tis he.

849
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,625
You admire Lord Tewkesbury?

850
01:00:06,291 --> 01:00:07,291
No!

851
01:00:08,125 --> 01:00:09,583
No.

852
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:12,416
We are old friends.

853
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:15,708
I hear he's a good man,
and a great reformer.

854
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:17,500
Hm.

855
01:00:18,166 --> 01:00:21,041
Well, if you wish to dance with him,
you may have to wait.

856
01:00:21,125 --> 01:00:22,250
There's quite a queue.

857
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:27,125
Yes, I mustn't lose my chance.

858
01:00:29,625 --> 01:00:31,208
Good evening, Miss...?

859
01:00:31,291 --> 01:00:32,291
Tabitha.

860
01:00:33,041 --> 01:00:34,041
Cicely.

861
01:00:41,625 --> 01:00:43,791
Forgive me for interrupting.
My name is Cicely.

862
01:00:43,875 --> 01:00:47,208
Um, your friend Tabitha
suggested we might dance.

863
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:49,166
Did she?

864
01:00:56,416 --> 01:01:01,000
Ladies and gentlemen, please
take your partners for the last waltz.

865
01:01:27,458 --> 01:01:29,916
You know, I swear I know your face.

866
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,333
What must it be?

867
01:01:31,916 --> 01:01:33,375
We have never met before,

868
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:36,208
but I've seen you looking. Why?

869
01:01:39,958 --> 01:01:42,500
<i>Of course. The Paragon Music Hall.</i>

870
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:45,666
I saw you talking
with a young woman there.

871
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:47,666
Sarah Chapman.

872
01:01:49,541 --> 01:01:52,000
Dislocate from me and I will scream.

873
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:55,666
The police are onto you, Mr. Lyon.
As it happens, they are onto us both.

874
01:01:57,875 --> 01:01:59,958
You were not invited here.
What do you want?

875
01:02:00,041 --> 01:02:03,625
<i>I'm a private detective,
hired by Sarah's sister to find her.</i>

876
01:02:04,208 --> 01:02:05,500
Bessie hired you?

877
01:02:05,583 --> 01:02:06,666
You know Bessie?

878
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,125
Leave me be, please,

879
01:02:11,041 --> 01:02:12,500
or you will ruin everything.

880
01:02:13,125 --> 01:02:16,000
- How? What will I ruin?
<i>- </i>They're watching.

881
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:21,000
If you must persist with this,
meet me in the library at midnight.

882
01:02:22,041 --> 01:02:23,333
Say nothing more now.

883
01:02:24,916 --> 01:02:26,041
Midnight it is.

884
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:56,791
"Moriarty."

885
01:02:59,333 --> 01:03:00,333
Who are you?

886
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,958
- My word, you do get in awkward places.
- Why are you holding a poker?

887
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:17,208
You must leave. I'm waiting for another.

888
01:03:17,291 --> 01:03:19,416
Another you're scared of
such that you need a weapon?

889
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,750
You are always here
when I don't want you to be.

890
01:03:21,833 --> 01:03:23,416
And sometimes here when you do.

891
01:03:23,958 --> 01:03:26,500
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing that need concern you.

892
01:03:28,166 --> 01:03:32,166
I like the look of the one you were
dancing with. What's her name, Cicely?

893
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:33,958
She would make you an excellent wife.

894
01:03:34,458 --> 01:03:36,291
Enola, I am concerned only for you.

895
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:39,333
Tewkesbury, if you're still here,
you may scare him away.

896
01:03:39,416 --> 01:03:42,375
"Scare him"? All of this is over a man?

897
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:45,250
Just leave.

898
01:03:55,875 --> 01:03:56,875
Lord Tewkesbury.

899
01:04:00,458 --> 01:04:02,416
Enola Holmes, you're under arrest.

900
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,958
Try to escape,
and we will make this difficult.

901
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:08,416
Let's make it quiet and spare
the fine people any embarrassment.

902
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,625
- Sir, whatever this is about, I'm sure...
- Murder, sir.

903
01:04:13,458 --> 01:04:14,708
It's about murder.

904
01:04:17,916 --> 01:04:19,500
Tewkesbury, it's all right.

905
01:04:20,375 --> 01:04:21,666
Constable, go on.

906
01:04:23,291 --> 01:04:24,375
Keep them safe.

907
01:04:25,875 --> 01:04:27,916
- Please.
- Come along.

908
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:32,833
Ow.

909
01:04:35,541 --> 01:04:37,666
- Oh, I say.
- I knew she didn't belong here.

910
01:04:45,958 --> 01:04:47,875
- Despicable.
- Disgraceful.

911
01:04:57,791 --> 01:04:59,041
Quite a party.

912
01:05:00,333 --> 01:05:03,541
You danced with young Master Lyon, I hear.

913
01:05:04,916 --> 01:05:08,166
May I ask, impertinently, I'm sure,

914
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:09,708
did you want to kiss him,

915
01:05:10,416 --> 01:05:12,541
or find out more about your case,

916
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:14,666
this Sarah Chapman?

917
01:05:19,625 --> 01:05:23,541
Look, if you're trying to protect her,

918
01:05:24,458 --> 01:05:25,458
know this.

919
01:05:26,291 --> 01:05:28,750
I will protect her better.

920
01:05:30,125 --> 01:05:32,000
There's someone wants to talk to her,

921
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:34,625
and they're not as kind as me.

922
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:36,250
"Someone"?

923
01:05:39,125 --> 01:05:39,958
Who?

924
01:05:42,166 --> 01:05:44,750
Why were you following me that night?

925
01:05:47,916 --> 01:05:50,416
You were following Mae too, weren't you?

926
01:05:51,416 --> 01:05:52,958
That's why you found the flat.

927
01:05:57,416 --> 01:05:58,416
Nice shirt.

928
01:05:59,333 --> 01:06:00,333
Silk?

929
01:06:01,041 --> 01:06:02,375
On a policeman's salary?

930
01:06:04,583 --> 01:06:07,541
Who's paying you, Superintendent Grail?

931
01:06:07,625 --> 01:06:10,000
Who's paying you to kill match girls?

932
01:06:10,083 --> 01:06:11,916
Where's Sarah Chapman?

933
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,416
- I don't know.
- She's a thief and a troublemaker.

934
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,875
You don't want to risk your skin for her.

935
01:06:19,458 --> 01:06:23,125
Well, if I can't find it out from you,
I'll find it out from someone else,

936
01:06:23,208 --> 01:06:26,041
like her sister, little Bessie.

937
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:28,541
She's just a little girl.

938
01:06:28,625 --> 01:06:31,291
Oh, but that's how it starts,
Enola Holmes!

939
01:06:31,375 --> 01:06:35,708
With little girls like her,
and you, and Sarah Chapman,

940
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:38,583
asking questions,
doubting those in charge,

941
01:06:38,666 --> 01:06:40,958
not seeing their protection
for what it is,

942
01:06:41,041 --> 01:06:42,583
trying to tear it down.

943
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:47,041
Well, it only takes one little flame
to start a fire,

944
01:06:47,125 --> 01:06:50,083
and my job is to keep
crushing those bloody flames out.

945
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,166
Now, I'll be kind

946
01:06:55,666 --> 01:06:57,500
and give you one last chance.

947
01:06:59,833 --> 01:07:00,833
Where is she?

948
01:07:02,333 --> 01:07:03,333
I don't know.

949
01:07:10,916 --> 01:07:12,375
Then you're for the noose.

950
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:14,458
Some detective you were.

951
01:07:16,041 --> 01:07:17,791
Should have stuck to needlework.

952
01:07:31,541 --> 01:07:32,666
Sir?

953
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:34,101
- Sir.
- Don't be ridi...

954
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:39,166
Superintendent Grail.

955
01:07:40,666 --> 01:07:42,166
Mr. Holmes.

956
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,360
I'm here for my sister.

957
01:07:45,833 --> 01:07:47,708
If you can arrange her release,

958
01:07:49,416 --> 01:07:50,583
I'd much appreciate it.

959
01:07:52,625 --> 01:07:54,041
She is my ward and a minor.

960
01:07:54,791 --> 01:07:55,791
And a murderer.

961
01:07:55,875 --> 01:07:58,208
Any evidence you think
you have against her...

962
01:07:58,291 --> 01:07:59,541
I have plenty.

963
01:08:00,875 --> 01:08:04,375
She was seen arguing with the victim,
following the victim,

964
01:08:04,458 --> 01:08:08,166
fighting with the victim, and lastly,
standing over the victim's dead body.

965
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:11,041
And when we find her there,
with blood on her hands,

966
01:08:11,125 --> 01:08:12,541
she bloody runs.

967
01:08:15,416 --> 01:08:16,583
I saw your murder site.

968
01:08:20,791 --> 01:08:24,416
Marks on and around the door
show that it was forced open,

969
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:25,791
and recently.

970
01:08:25,875 --> 01:08:27,208
There were signs of a scuffle

971
01:08:27,291 --> 01:08:30,291
and boot marks
from three separate intruders.

972
01:08:30,375 --> 01:08:31,833
One of them heavyset,

973
01:08:32,625 --> 01:08:35,416
judging by the height and extent
of the subsequent damage.

974
01:08:36,416 --> 01:08:38,833
Traces of fabric and spots of blood

975
01:08:38,916 --> 01:08:42,750
suggests that there was
another occupant, likely female,

976
01:08:42,833 --> 01:08:44,500
who seems to have fought back,

977
01:08:44,583 --> 01:08:47,583
using a sharp and improvised weapon...

978
01:08:50,916 --> 01:08:52,791
before escaping through the window.

979
01:08:52,875 --> 01:08:55,125
This was a targeted
search and interrogation

980
01:08:55,208 --> 01:08:57,291
in which two women were discovered,

981
01:08:57,375 --> 01:08:59,416
and then my sister arrived,

982
01:09:00,375 --> 01:09:03,041
and you were curiously fast
to arrive after her.

983
01:09:03,625 --> 01:09:06,250
Now, are you going to release her,
or shall I?

984
01:09:09,333 --> 01:09:12,416
- Sergeant Beeston, if you please.
- Sir.

985
01:09:13,875 --> 01:09:15,375
Fingerprint matching.

986
01:09:15,458 --> 01:09:17,375
New invention, Swiss.

987
01:09:17,458 --> 01:09:20,166
- You have heard of it?
- I have.

988
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:22,041
Would you care to look?

989
01:09:24,791 --> 01:09:27,083
Makes our work so much more efficient,

990
01:09:28,125 --> 01:09:29,916
especially in a murder case.

991
01:09:36,333 --> 01:09:38,166
My sister never touched that weapon.

992
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:41,125
Then why are her prints on it?

993
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:49,750
It's a great age we live in,
isn't it, Mr. Holmes?

994
01:10:13,041 --> 01:10:15,250
Have you any sense
what time it is?

995
01:10:16,333 --> 01:10:19,583
- Hello, Edith.
- You're lucky, I almost broke your legs.

996
01:10:20,375 --> 01:10:22,083
Then I recognized the shoulders.

997
01:10:22,708 --> 01:10:25,916
- You have very recognizable shoulders.
- Enola's been arrested.

998
01:10:27,416 --> 01:10:28,458
For why?

999
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:30,208
Murder.

1000
01:10:32,875 --> 01:10:34,833
<i>What she's got tangled with,</i>

1001
01:10:35,416 --> 01:10:37,333
<i>it may go wider than I thought.</i>

1002
01:10:39,666 --> 01:10:41,791
And there's something
about this case that...

1003
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:45,750
Deduction alone will not solve?

1004
01:10:47,875 --> 01:10:50,000
I may need your...

1005
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:54,500
I need your help.

1006
01:10:56,541 --> 01:10:58,291
<i>We need your help.</i>

1007
01:10:58,833 --> 01:11:01,416
Exercise for 15 minutes.

1008
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:04,083
<i>Well, like my mother always said,</i>

1009
01:11:04,166 --> 01:11:06,500
<i>"Those who can turn to others
when they're in need</i>

1010
01:11:06,583 --> 01:11:08,500
<i>are the truly brave amongst us."</i>

1011
01:11:09,333 --> 01:11:11,458
Your mother sounds very different to mine.

1012
01:11:22,666 --> 01:11:24,125
I did try to stop her,

1013
01:11:24,208 --> 01:11:27,541
but she's full of this fight.

1014
01:11:30,583 --> 01:11:32,166
There we go. Finally.

1015
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:34,625
<i>You can't control Enola Holmes.</i>

1016
01:11:34,708 --> 01:11:37,041
She's a force of nature,

1017
01:11:37,791 --> 01:11:38,916
<i>a law unto herself.</i>

1018
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,541
Go easy on her, girls.

1019
01:11:43,083 --> 01:11:44,083
Yes, she is.

1020
01:11:46,083 --> 01:11:47,375
And I fear she will hang.

1021
01:12:04,833 --> 01:12:05,833
Hm?

1022
01:12:19,458 --> 01:12:20,458
Come on, girls!

1023
01:12:22,833 --> 01:12:23,666
In there.

1024
01:12:25,458 --> 01:12:26,625
'Tis I.

1025
01:12:28,833 --> 01:12:30,958
Yah!

1026
01:12:32,541 --> 01:12:33,750
Oh, it is good to see you.

1027
01:12:34,666 --> 01:12:35,906
Yah!

1028
01:12:35,958 --> 01:12:37,041
Hang on!

1029
01:12:41,166 --> 01:12:42,166
Yah!

1030
01:12:44,583 --> 01:12:46,000
They're onto us!

1031
01:12:47,083 --> 01:12:49,125
- Yah!
- Be ready in there!

1032
01:12:51,125 --> 01:12:53,208
So this case of yours, how's it going?

1033
01:12:53,291 --> 01:12:54,166
I don't know.

1034
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:57,375
I was trying to help a girl find
her sister, and I've made things worse.

1035
01:12:57,458 --> 01:12:58,458
Nonsense.

1036
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:01,208
You stirred up a hornet's nest.
You are onto something.

1037
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,333
- Standby!
- Why else would they try and silence you?

1038
01:13:07,291 --> 01:13:09,375
Don't worry, it's completely harmless.

1039
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:14,000
- On your left!
- My left or yours?

1040
01:13:14,833 --> 01:13:15,916
Yours!

1041
01:13:33,083 --> 01:13:35,500
This match factory,
what do you know about it?

1042
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:36,958
It's a roaring success.

1043
01:13:37,041 --> 01:13:39,166
In two years, it's doubled its profits.

1044
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:41,416
- And now there's typhus.
- Typhus?

1045
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:44,125
Yes, the girls are going down with it.
They're dying.

1046
01:13:45,416 --> 01:13:46,416
That's a loose thread.

1047
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:48,125
- What?
- They're back!

1048
01:13:48,833 --> 01:13:49,833
Yah!

1049
01:13:50,708 --> 01:13:53,416
Here they come! Brace yourselves!

1050
01:14:01,458 --> 01:14:03,208
We know about these factories.

1051
01:14:03,291 --> 01:14:04,750
Come on, come on!

1052
01:14:04,833 --> 01:14:06,958
Girls like Sarah Chapman,
they're expendable.

1053
01:14:07,041 --> 01:14:09,750
They go missing,
too often they die, no one cares.

1054
01:14:09,833 --> 01:14:12,791
But this girl, they care about.
And greatly.

1055
01:14:12,875 --> 01:14:14,291
So, what does she know?

1056
01:14:14,375 --> 01:14:16,375
Get up here now!

1057
01:14:16,458 --> 01:14:18,458
She stole something. Some papers.

1058
01:14:18,541 --> 01:14:22,708
Aha! So what's she gonna do with them?
What's her plan? She's not a thief.

1059
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:26,291
She's not a blackmailer.
She is a troublemaker.

1060
01:14:26,375 --> 01:14:28,250
She knows something,

1061
01:14:28,333 --> 01:14:30,875
and that is infinitely more dangerous.

1062
01:14:31,375 --> 01:14:32,375
Come on, lads!

1063
01:14:39,291 --> 01:14:41,791
- Stand by to the right!
- Would you mind?

1064
01:14:41,875 --> 01:14:43,500
- Wait for it.
- W-W-Where?

1065
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:45,333
- Wait for it!
- Straight.

1066
01:14:46,041 --> 01:14:47,041
Now!

1067
01:14:48,208 --> 01:14:50,250
Get it out!
Get it out of here!

1068
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:06,500
Now, whatever Sarah's hiding, Enola,

1069
01:15:07,625 --> 01:15:08,625
it's a secret.

1070
01:15:10,916 --> 01:15:13,666
You need to look
for what she knows, Enola.

1071
01:15:16,208 --> 01:15:18,375
Find that out,
and everything else will follow.

1072
01:15:20,666 --> 01:15:22,083
She's probably under your nose.

1073
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:26,041
- Huh?
- Get down!

1074
01:15:28,125 --> 01:15:29,041
That's just rude.

1075
01:15:32,041 --> 01:15:33,875
Grail.

1076
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,240
You all right, Edith?

1077
01:15:40,291 --> 01:15:41,583
Just about! Yah!

1078
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:49,500
Yah!

1079
01:15:56,208 --> 01:15:57,541
Yah!

1080
01:15:59,291 --> 01:16:00,833
Oh, for goodness sake!

1081
01:16:06,625 --> 01:16:07,625
Oh!

1082
01:16:18,958 --> 01:16:19,958
That's not good.

1083
01:16:20,041 --> 01:16:21,583
Get 'em to the bank!

1084
01:16:22,875 --> 01:16:24,583
You all right? You all right?

1085
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:27,860
- All right?
- I'm all right, yeah.

1086
01:16:28,791 --> 01:16:29,833
Oh no.

1087
01:16:29,916 --> 01:16:30,916
Sir.

1088
01:16:35,416 --> 01:16:36,791
Glory be.

1089
01:16:37,833 --> 01:16:38,958
It's the Holy Trinity.

1090
01:16:41,916 --> 01:16:43,583
I'll make commissioner for this.

1091
01:16:44,916 --> 01:16:45,916
Take 'em.

1092
01:16:47,791 --> 01:16:48,916
Must we?

1093
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:49,875
I fear so.

I never valued my pelvis.

01:18:06,291 --> 01:18:07,541
How about you, Edith?

1115
01:18:07,625 --> 01:18:09,166
- How are the kidneys?
- Fine.

1116
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:10,916
I quite enjoyed it.

1117
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,083
Hm. You enjoy everything.
It's most irritating.

1118
01:18:14,625 --> 01:18:16,750
Come on, this way.
Better get a move on.

1119
01:18:16,833 --> 01:18:17,833
All right.

1120
01:18:19,958 --> 01:18:23,958
So, um, how's that useless boy of yours?

1121
01:18:25,458 --> 01:18:26,875
I hear he's doing good work.

1122
01:18:29,125 --> 01:18:30,583
- He is.
- Uh-huh.

1123
01:18:31,625 --> 01:18:34,708
Well then,
perhaps not so useless after all.

1124
01:18:35,875 --> 01:18:38,541
I wouldn't say he's "my boy."

1125
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:46,458
You know, I sometimes think
I brought you up to be too independent.

1126
01:18:47,041 --> 01:18:49,208
- Mother!
- I did it with all of you.

1127
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:53,458
Your purpose must be to find who you are.

1128
01:18:53,541 --> 01:18:56,333
<i>You, Sherlock, Mycroft.</i>

1129
01:18:56,833 --> 01:18:59,458
Strong, formidable, individual children,

1130
01:18:59,541 --> 01:19:03,166
but, well, perhaps a little lonely.

1131
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:08,166
You will do very well on your own, Enola.

1132
01:19:08,916 --> 01:19:13,250
But with others, you could be magnificent.

1133
01:19:15,875 --> 01:19:19,375
Who do you think
organized all of this after all? Hm?

1134
01:19:19,875 --> 01:19:20,875
Me?

1135
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:25,791
No, you find your allies.

1136
01:19:26,375 --> 01:19:29,750
Work with them,
and you will become more of who you are.

1137
01:19:31,041 --> 01:19:32,541
You speak with one voice,

1138
01:19:33,083 --> 01:19:36,208
and you will make more noise
than you could ever have imagined.

1139
01:19:38,416 --> 01:19:42,041
Come on. She should go.
We'll put them off her scent.

1140
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:46,291
So, you dust yourself down...

1141
01:19:49,333 --> 01:19:50,416
...keep facing forward.

1142
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:55,500
And if you ever get condemned
for murder again, you give me a shout.

1143
01:19:56,666 --> 01:19:57,666
I will.

1144
01:20:02,125 --> 01:20:03,208
Thank you, Edith.

1145
01:20:08,416 --> 01:20:09,250
Be careful.

1146
01:20:25,291 --> 01:20:26,666
And get a haircut.

1147
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:27,875
It's a mess.

1148
01:20:30,375 --> 01:20:31,750
I think my hair is fine.

1149
01:20:45,083 --> 01:20:46,250
Come on.

1150
01:20:51,208 --> 01:20:52,833
<i>I need you to pack your things.</i>

1151
01:20:52,916 --> 01:20:55,125
I need you to be in a safer place.

1152
01:20:55,208 --> 01:20:57,833
Is... Is my sister gone?

1153
01:20:57,916 --> 01:20:59,500
- Like Mae?
- No.

1154
01:20:59,583 --> 01:21:00,750
- Is she...
- No.

1155
01:21:00,833 --> 01:21:02,333
I'm sure she's all right.

1156
01:21:02,416 --> 01:21:04,333
I'm closer to finding her.

1157
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:07,250
Doris,

1158
01:21:08,583 --> 01:21:09,666
she'll take me in.

1159
01:21:10,291 --> 01:21:12,000
She's got a spare bed now.

1160
01:21:13,916 --> 01:21:14,916
Her sister?

1161
01:21:16,291 --> 01:21:17,291
Dead.

1162
01:21:17,375 --> 01:21:18,375
Typhus.

1163
01:21:23,333 --> 01:21:24,333
Dead.

1164
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:38,416
There's traces of something in this soil.

1165
01:21:41,083 --> 01:21:42,958
One has red, and one has white in it.

1166
01:21:46,416 --> 01:21:50,166
The matches you make,
when did they change from red to white?

1167
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:52,625
I dunno. Around two years ago.

1168
01:21:52,708 --> 01:21:58,541
In two years, he's turned red into black.
Or should I say red into white?

1169
01:21:59,125 --> 01:22:00,916
Typhus.
The plague of our times.

1170
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,583
Two years it's been killing these girls.

1171
01:22:23,541 --> 01:22:24,541
Out.

1172
01:22:25,625 --> 01:22:26,833
What are you looking at?

1173
01:23:00,875 --> 01:23:01,875
I need your help.

1174
01:23:04,416 --> 01:23:06,166
Don't make me repeat it! May I come in?

1175
01:23:08,208 --> 01:23:11,541
Firstly, I would like to apologize
for so much.

1176
01:23:11,625 --> 01:23:14,083
I have failed
to see allies in plain sight.

1177
01:23:14,166 --> 01:23:15,250
- And I have...
- Enola.

1178
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:17,916
There's something I wish to say too.

1179
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,520
- All right.
- If you'd just...

1180
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:29,041
All day, every day,
all I do is compromise.

1181
01:23:30,208 --> 01:23:33,476
If I vote for this lord's bill that will
allow him to pump bilge water into a lake,

1182
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,583
then he will vote for my forestry reform.

1183
01:23:35,666 --> 01:23:39,083
I want to stand up and say,
"This isn't right," but I have no allies.

1184
01:23:39,875 --> 01:23:42,500
So to do so
would be to risk all that is good,

1185
01:23:42,583 --> 01:23:45,291
so I lie awake trying to work out
which path to follow,

1186
01:23:46,166 --> 01:23:47,166
alone.

1187
01:23:48,833 --> 01:23:50,416
There is no search for a wife,

1188
01:23:51,375 --> 01:23:54,708
because politics consumes me constantly.

1189
01:23:57,625 --> 01:23:59,625
That is the speech I stored up for you.

1190
01:24:02,875 --> 01:24:03,875
You're a good man.

1191
01:24:05,166 --> 01:24:06,166
I'm a man now?

1192
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:07,750
On occasion.

1193
01:24:08,416 --> 01:24:11,500
But I understand your struggle,
because I struggle too.

1194
01:24:12,291 --> 01:24:14,250
I am sorry we cannot talk more,
because I have...

1195
01:24:14,333 --> 01:24:16,208
A case to solve?

1196
01:24:20,666 --> 01:24:22,916
The girl I'm looking for, Sarah Chapman,

1197
01:24:23,791 --> 01:24:25,541
she has proof that girls are dying

1198
01:24:25,625 --> 01:24:27,958
from the phosphorus
they work with every day.

1199
01:24:28,041 --> 01:24:31,541
And the factory
are trying to cover it up as typhus.

1200
01:24:32,583 --> 01:24:33,583
She knows it,

1201
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:36,833
and someone is going to kill her for it.

1202
01:24:36,916 --> 01:24:38,000
Then what can we do?

1203
01:24:40,333 --> 01:24:41,333
We?

1204
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:50,373
- Don't open it. it could be the police.
- You're still wanted by the police?

1205
01:24:50,416 --> 01:24:52,583
- Of course. I escaped jail.
- You escaped?

1206
01:24:52,666 --> 01:24:53,833
Forget I told you that.

1207
01:24:55,416 --> 01:24:58,500
The lights are on. If I don't answer,
they'll suspect more. Hide.

1208
01:24:58,583 --> 01:25:00,343
Coming.

1209
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:04,670
- Miss Cicely.
- I'm sorry it's so late.

1210
01:25:04,708 --> 01:25:08,375
No, no, not at all.
I-I told you to come. I-I want to help.

1211
01:25:08,458 --> 01:25:10,625
- Is anyone else here?
- No.

1212
01:25:10,708 --> 01:25:11,958
- Um...
- Good.

1213
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:15,458
Better we are alone, for it is imperative
that I speak with you.

1214
01:25:15,958 --> 01:25:18,541
Sir, I feel that you're a man
of great character

1215
01:25:18,625 --> 01:25:19,750
and that I can trust you.

1216
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:23,750
Which is why I fear I may have to unburden
myself, and it may prove shocking.

1217
01:25:23,833 --> 01:25:24,916
Miss Cicely...

1218
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,041
It's just, I've been wanting
to speak with you about... a relationship.

1219
01:25:29,125 --> 01:25:32,416
Oh, that. Yes. Uh, perhaps
we can discuss this another time?

1220
01:25:33,458 --> 01:25:34,291
Please, sir.

1221
01:25:34,375 --> 01:25:37,750
I'm terribly sorry. Let me assure you,
I do share your interest.

1222
01:25:37,833 --> 01:25:40,291
- We will talk again.
- Thank you.

1223
01:25:43,291 --> 01:25:45,625
She's gone. She was flustered.

1224
01:25:48,458 --> 01:25:51,291
Do not think of doubting me.
Cicely was here for my help.

1225
01:25:51,875 --> 01:25:55,000
She told me at the ball that she's working
on a bill to change factory law.

1226
01:25:56,333 --> 01:25:58,833
She's unearthed something,
some corruption or other.

1227
01:25:59,458 --> 01:26:00,708
She's doing what?

1228
01:26:05,291 --> 01:26:09,125
Enola, if you have any concerns,
I tell you categorically, I...

1229
01:26:09,208 --> 01:26:10,875
I have no eyes for anyone, but...

1230
01:26:12,541 --> 01:26:14,666
Well, no, this is not
quite how I wanted to say that.

1231
01:26:15,708 --> 01:26:18,583
But to say,
in terms of romantic interests,

1232
01:26:19,083 --> 01:26:21,250
yes, my interest is...

1233
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:24,517
The reason I don't have to search,
I'm busy with politics, like I said...

1234
01:26:24,541 --> 01:26:25,981
<i>You admire Lord Tewkesbury?</i>

1235
01:26:26,041 --> 01:26:28,666
I hear he is a good man
and a great reformer.

1236
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:31,125
The woman I would be most interested in...

1237
01:26:31,208 --> 01:26:32,583
I mustn't lose my chance.

1238
01:26:33,916 --> 01:26:34,916
You're not listening.

1239
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,791
Good evening, Lord Tewkesbury.

1240
01:26:36,875 --> 01:26:38,583
She didn't have a chaperone.

1241
01:26:40,833 --> 01:26:43,208
You got five seconds
to tell me why you're here.

1242
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,291
<i>I have been blind!</i>

1243
01:26:45,375 --> 01:26:48,250
The phosphorus in the match-making
has mixed with oxygen.

1244
01:26:49,166 --> 01:26:50,666
I have missed everything.

1245
01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:52,208
She's probably under your nose.

1246
01:26:55,541 --> 01:26:56,875
Cicely.

1247
01:27:05,458 --> 01:27:07,583
Sarah is Cicely.

1248
01:27:09,375 --> 01:27:11,250
Cicely is Sarah!

1249
01:27:11,875 --> 01:27:13,083
Enola!

1250
01:27:13,708 --> 01:27:15,000
Enola, what on Earth...

1251
01:27:17,458 --> 01:27:19,375
Enola, did you understand what I said?

1252
01:27:20,083 --> 01:27:24,083
Or rather what I didn't say?
Did you understand... what I didn't say?

1253
01:27:24,166 --> 01:27:26,375
Yes. You were saying that you...

1254
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:35,916
<i>You'll learn.</i>

1255
01:27:37,041 --> 01:27:40,833
That message
you sent me with the fan at the ball,

1256
01:27:40,916 --> 01:27:41,916
what did it mean?

1257
01:27:45,666 --> 01:27:46,708
It means I love you.

1258
01:27:55,083 --> 01:27:58,250
Ladies and gentlemen,
to the future.

1259
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:03,750
Of course.

1260
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,333
They were working together, in love.

1261
01:28:09,458 --> 01:28:10,833
They had a plan.

1262
01:28:12,208 --> 01:28:16,583
To expose the corruption in that factory
and stop what his father was doing.

1263
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:18,625
They wanted your help.

1264
01:28:18,708 --> 01:28:20,833
William Lyon invited you to that ball.

1265
01:28:20,916 --> 01:28:22,458
He's a radical just like you.

1266
01:28:23,125 --> 01:28:25,166
They needed my help. You're right.

1267
01:28:25,958 --> 01:28:27,750
But, Enola, we must return inside.

1268
01:28:27,833 --> 01:28:30,166
The police are pursuing you,
and we have much to talk of.

1269
01:28:30,250 --> 01:28:32,916
No! I know we have much to talk of,
my dear, dear lord.

1270
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,125
You love me.

1271
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:36,250
And as it turns out, I love you too.

1272
01:28:37,583 --> 01:28:38,583
You love me too?

1273
01:28:41,041 --> 01:28:42,833
You really are a nincompoop.

1274
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Now hail a cab.

1275
01:28:57,083 --> 01:29:00,875
- Shh. You're walking loudly.
- But it's gravel.

1276
01:29:00,958 --> 01:29:03,118
- You've got large feet.
- I know.

1277
01:29:08,291 --> 01:29:10,541
Wait here. Keep guard.

1278
01:29:10,625 --> 01:29:12,916
If anyone comes,
just tell them you're a lord.

1279
01:29:13,708 --> 01:29:14,708
I am a lord.

1280
01:29:15,291 --> 01:29:16,916
Then they'll likely believe you.

1281
01:29:17,583 --> 01:29:18,583
All right.

1282
01:30:09,833 --> 01:30:11,041
You.

1283
01:30:13,458 --> 01:30:15,750
- How ridiculous you are.
- I'm ridiculous?

1284
01:30:15,833 --> 01:30:18,000
I told you to stay safe and stay away.

1285
01:30:18,083 --> 01:30:20,791
Now you're breaking out of prison
and have the police after you.

1286
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:24,125
Oh. Are you hurt? I am sorry.

1287
01:30:24,208 --> 01:30:25,666
Are you not hurt?

1288
01:30:27,208 --> 01:30:28,208
It seems not.

1289
01:30:29,125 --> 01:30:30,125
Hm.

1290
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:32,583
I wonder who taught you
to fight like that.

1291
01:30:33,333 --> 01:30:35,083
Another thing our mother
has to answer for.

1292
01:30:35,166 --> 01:30:37,583
She should have fed me as well as you
is what I think.

1293
01:30:38,625 --> 01:30:41,458
Hang on. Why are you here?
Is it my case, or your own?

1294
01:30:42,041 --> 01:30:45,416
Both. I know how Grail
got your fingerprints.

1295
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:47,416
Oxidized phosphorus dust

1296
01:30:48,333 --> 01:30:50,708
lifted from the table
and applied to the knife.

1297
01:30:51,791 --> 01:30:52,791
You're innocent.

1298
01:30:53,916 --> 01:30:55,041
You doubted it?

1299
01:30:55,791 --> 01:30:57,541
Nothing's certain till it's proved.

1300
01:30:59,416 --> 01:31:00,500
And your case?

1301
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,166
My adversary, his trail,

1302
01:31:03,791 --> 01:31:04,916
it leads here.

1303
01:31:06,875 --> 01:31:08,833
It seems our cases are connected.

1304
01:31:11,083 --> 01:31:11,958
Shall we?

1305
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:45,500
William Lyon.

1306
01:31:46,875 --> 01:31:48,416
Sarah's love.

1307
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:50,791
And my thief in a taper crown hat.

1308
01:31:57,458 --> 01:32:01,000
Stay unemotional. There's nothing more
we can do for him now.

1309
01:32:01,708 --> 01:32:04,375
Need to keep our minds fresh
and our eyes sharp.

1310
01:32:04,875 --> 01:32:06,250
He was seized.

1311
01:32:07,583 --> 01:32:10,500
- Yes, and searched.
- For the document he took?

1312
01:32:11,833 --> 01:32:12,833
A knife?

1313
01:32:13,250 --> 01:32:14,250
No, bigger.

1314
01:32:15,833 --> 01:32:16,833
A cutlass.

1315
01:32:18,916 --> 01:32:20,208
Heavy boot scuffs,

1316
01:32:21,625 --> 01:32:24,208
and scratch marks from a cane
that has a metal ferrule.

1317
01:32:26,083 --> 01:32:27,250
Grail.

1318
01:32:28,291 --> 01:32:29,791
But at whose behest?

1319
01:32:30,916 --> 01:32:32,666
There was another in this room.

1320
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:34,333
This cigar had a holder.

1321
01:32:38,041 --> 01:32:39,708
And traces of wool.

1322
01:32:42,083 --> 01:32:44,625
Astrakhan, the finest.

1323
01:32:44,708 --> 01:32:49,083
Well, Lord McIntyre,
if I, um, might suggest a little lunch.

1324
01:32:50,416 --> 01:32:53,166
<i>Leave me be, please.
They're watching.</i>

1325
01:32:56,583 --> 01:32:58,041
Where did William steal from?

1326
01:32:58,541 --> 01:33:00,583
- The Treasury Office?
- Yes.

1327
01:33:00,666 --> 01:33:03,333
The office of Lord McIntyre,
Treasury Minister.

1328
01:33:03,916 --> 01:33:05,166
How did you come to that?

1329
01:33:06,375 --> 01:33:08,500
I think what William stole was proof

1330
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:11,500
that Lyon and McIntyre
were conspiring together.

1331
01:33:12,583 --> 01:33:14,208
- Corruption.
- Yes.

1332
01:33:14,291 --> 01:33:16,041
Fueled by greed.

1333
01:33:16,708 --> 01:33:20,083
McIntyre has been secretly profiting
from the factory.

1334
01:33:20,166 --> 01:33:23,041
They changed the match formula
to a cheaper phosphorus,

1335
01:33:24,541 --> 01:33:25,708
and it's deadly.

1336
01:33:26,333 --> 01:33:27,208
Enola?

1337
01:33:27,291 --> 01:33:28,833
Enola, I was concerned for you.

1338
01:33:28,916 --> 01:33:31,708
You left me out there in the dark,
and I nearly tore my...

1339
01:33:35,208 --> 01:33:37,125
- Sherlock Holmes? How do...
- Not the time.

1340
01:33:39,416 --> 01:33:40,416
Oh my...

1341
01:33:41,666 --> 01:33:43,000
- Is he...
- Stay unemotional.

1342
01:33:44,833 --> 01:33:47,166
- Who did this?
- Lord McIntyre.

1343
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:49,791
- No.
- But it all fits.

1344
01:33:49,875 --> 01:33:53,083
No one has sat in this chair.
No marks on the carpet, no indentation.

1345
01:33:53,166 --> 01:33:56,291
The cigar has been smoked, but cold.

1346
01:33:57,125 --> 01:33:59,625
And look, no ash.

1347
01:34:01,875 --> 01:34:04,541
- No lips have touched that glass.
- Exactly.

1348
01:34:04,625 --> 01:34:07,125
These clues
have been planted for us to find,

1349
01:34:07,708 --> 01:34:09,250
to mislead us from the true villain.

1350
01:34:10,250 --> 01:34:11,500
This has all been staged.

1351
01:34:13,250 --> 01:34:14,250
By who?

1352
01:34:14,833 --> 01:34:18,958
Not McIntyre, but by someone who had
a lot to lose without that document.

1353
01:34:19,041 --> 01:34:22,000
Someone who knew what they were up to
and was blackmailing them.

1354
01:34:23,375 --> 01:34:24,375
My opponent.

1355
01:34:27,208 --> 01:34:28,875
Someone who likes a game.

1356
01:34:30,833 --> 01:34:34,083
- Did they get what they wanted?
- No, I don't think so.

1357
01:34:36,958 --> 01:34:37,958
Poor William.

1358
01:34:47,708 --> 01:34:48,708
Hm.

1359
01:34:55,416 --> 01:34:58,541
- They did get something.
- Mae's terrible music.

1360
01:34:59,208 --> 01:35:00,916
"The Truth of the Gods."

1361
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,750
Could be biblical, mythical.

1362
01:35:02,833 --> 01:35:03,833
Theatrical?

1363
01:35:07,416 --> 01:35:10,166
The Gods is the top row of the theater.

1364
01:35:10,833 --> 01:35:11,833
<i>The balcony.</i>

1365
01:35:12,916 --> 01:35:14,125
Doesn't everyone know that?

1366
01:35:16,083 --> 01:35:17,208
This isn't music.

1367
01:35:26,125 --> 01:35:27,125
It's a map.

1368
01:35:36,958 --> 01:35:39,625
Just to be clear
as to what we might be about to face...

1369
01:35:40,958 --> 01:35:43,541
There may be some violence.
You've faced it before.

1370
01:35:44,458 --> 01:35:45,458
Yes.

1371
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,791
I did have part of a suit of armor on.

1372
01:35:48,291 --> 01:35:51,416
But yes, fighting will be...

1373
01:35:52,458 --> 01:35:53,291
Yes.

1374
01:35:53,375 --> 01:35:55,750
- You've been in a fight before?
- Yes, plenty of fights.

1375
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:56,958
Fenced for my school.

1376
01:35:57,875 --> 01:35:58,875
Mm.

1377
01:36:02,458 --> 01:36:04,458
Fine. Can you teach me to fight?

1378
01:36:05,375 --> 01:36:07,833
What, right now? In a carriage?

1379
01:36:07,916 --> 01:36:10,916
Did I not teach you to dance
in five minutes in a bathroom?

1380
01:36:12,083 --> 01:36:14,166
All right. Fine.

1381
01:36:18,166 --> 01:36:21,750
There are two secrets to fighting.
Avoid the punch, make the counterpunch.

1382
01:36:23,250 --> 01:36:24,916
I don't see how two secrets... Ow!

1383
01:36:26,041 --> 01:36:27,375
Your first lesson.

1384
01:36:27,458 --> 01:36:28,458
Ow.

1385
01:36:29,416 --> 01:36:30,416
Ow!

1386
01:36:30,458 --> 01:36:32,583
Your second. You didn't avoid the punch.

1387
01:36:32,666 --> 01:36:35,833
- You can hardly expect me to hit a girl.
- Oh dear.

1388
01:36:35,916 --> 01:36:36,916
I'm not some... Ow!

1389
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:38,958
Ow! Will you stop that?

1390
01:36:39,458 --> 01:36:41,000
I can't stop.

1391
01:36:42,583 --> 01:36:45,958
We're approaching.

1392
01:37:11,416 --> 01:37:13,166
I may need more of those lessons.

1393
01:37:38,583 --> 01:37:40,250
X marks the spot.

1394
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:00,791
Sarah.

1395
01:38:03,583 --> 01:38:04,583
It's all there.

1396
01:38:06,250 --> 01:38:07,750
All the proof we need.

1397
01:38:09,458 --> 01:38:12,666
The contract
between Lyon and McIntyre

1398
01:38:13,541 --> 01:38:15,083
to change the phosphorus.

1399
01:38:17,375 --> 01:38:19,000
What William stole for you.

1400
01:38:24,166 --> 01:38:27,541
And the pages from the factory register.

1401
01:38:27,625 --> 01:38:29,750
That's what you stole from the office.

1402
01:38:31,125 --> 01:38:33,333
These are the names
of the girls they killed.

1403
01:38:33,416 --> 01:38:35,208
I couldn't let 'em be forgotten.

1404
01:38:37,125 --> 01:38:40,958
And it's proof that match girls
are dying from working in that factory,

1405
01:38:41,458 --> 01:38:42,833
and they knew it all along.

1406
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,291
You're a bloody good detective,
Enola Holmes.

1407
01:38:49,708 --> 01:38:51,250
You are too, Sarah Chapman.

1408
01:38:55,416 --> 01:38:57,750
I will share this with the world,
I promise you.

1409
01:38:59,875 --> 01:39:00,875
Thank you.

1410
01:39:02,291 --> 01:39:05,041
Now we must find William.
He was supposed to meet me six hours ago.

1411
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:10,083
I'm afraid William won't be coming.

1412
01:39:15,833 --> 01:39:16,833
What?

1413
01:39:20,250 --> 01:39:21,250
I'm sorry.

1414
01:39:22,750 --> 01:39:24,083
I'm so sorry.

1415
01:39:30,041 --> 01:39:32,000
I told him we had everything we needed.

1416
01:39:33,250 --> 01:39:34,750
That we should just go public.

1417
01:39:37,625 --> 01:39:41,583
He said nobody would care unless we had
someone in power who would listen.

1418
01:39:44,458 --> 01:39:46,583
He was just trying to keep me safe.

1419
01:39:48,916 --> 01:39:50,041
And now I've lost him.

1420
01:39:50,791 --> 01:39:53,000
We must move quickly,
or we'll lose you too.

1421
01:39:54,083 --> 01:39:55,791
Losing this...

1422
01:39:58,458 --> 01:39:59,708
losing that.

1423
01:40:03,458 --> 01:40:05,625
- Seems you've lost everything.
- Bessie!

1424
01:40:06,166 --> 01:40:08,083
You've all been very careless.

1425
01:40:14,083 --> 01:40:15,083
I'll take those.

1426
01:40:15,125 --> 01:40:16,333
Let go of her.

1427
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,708
Give me the papers and I will.

1428
01:40:35,875 --> 01:40:37,208
Run, Bessie!

1429
01:40:43,250 --> 01:40:46,333
Don't just stand there!

1430
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:53,375
Ow!

1431
01:40:53,458 --> 01:40:56,750
Get after them!

1432
01:41:12,750 --> 01:41:14,833
Ow.

1433
01:41:20,166 --> 01:41:21,958
Avoid the punch, make the counterpunch.

1434
01:41:44,916 --> 01:41:45,916
Tewkesbury!

1435
01:42:47,041 --> 01:42:48,250
Argh!

1436
01:42:48,333 --> 01:42:49,333
Argh.

1437
01:42:54,541 --> 01:42:55,541
No!

1438
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:07,125
Bessie!

1439
01:43:08,708 --> 01:43:10,000
Run.

1440
01:43:11,291 --> 01:43:12,541
I said run!

1441
01:43:57,041 --> 01:43:58,041
Enola!

1442
01:44:05,166 --> 01:44:08,125
<i>You got more to you than I thought.</i>

1443
01:45:14,250 --> 01:45:15,250
Huh.

1444
01:45:17,416 --> 01:45:19,583
What places we find ourselves in.

1445
01:45:24,666 --> 01:45:26,291
What places indeed.

1446
01:45:30,458 --> 01:45:32,833
I've always loved the theater.

1447
01:45:36,958 --> 01:45:37,791
Got it?

1448
01:45:37,875 --> 01:45:41,916
I used to dream
I'd end up on the stage.

1449
01:45:43,875 --> 01:45:45,083
You're not rid of me yet,

1450
01:45:45,166 --> 01:45:47,250
Viscount Tewkesbury,
Marquess of Basilwether.

1451
01:45:57,583 --> 01:45:59,083
Enola!

1452
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:07,541
Hurrah!

1453
01:46:18,833 --> 01:46:19,875
Are you all right?

1454
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:27,875
You were made to fight.

1455
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:40,958
Congratulations.

1456
01:46:43,083 --> 01:46:45,416
Lord McIntyre.
What are you doing here?

1457
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:47,833
I was summoned.

1458
01:46:48,666 --> 01:46:52,416
Your brother knew that I would want
to see the right people shown justice.

1459
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:54,666
And I don't know how to thank you

1460
01:46:54,750 --> 01:46:57,291
for retrieving this government property

1461
01:46:57,375 --> 01:46:59,666
and, uh, bringing this killer to light.

1462
01:46:59,750 --> 01:47:03,583
A rot amongst our ranks.

1463
01:47:06,166 --> 01:47:09,416
The world shall know
the name Enola Holmes,

1464
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:10,666
I'll make sure of it.

1465
01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:14,541
Lestrade, arrest that girl.

1466
01:47:15,541 --> 01:47:17,833
She's done nothing wrong.

1467
01:47:17,916 --> 01:47:19,833
On what charge, sir?

1468
01:47:19,916 --> 01:47:23,458
- Theft.
- All she stole from you was the truth.

1469
01:47:23,541 --> 01:47:25,708
She took personal information,

1470
01:47:26,625 --> 01:47:30,625
which she used
for extortion and blackmail.

1471
01:47:30,708 --> 01:47:33,416
Which is why she will serve her time.

1472
01:47:33,916 --> 01:47:34,916
Ah.

1473
01:47:36,958 --> 01:47:38,083
But you are mistaken.

1474
01:47:39,166 --> 01:47:42,041
She was not your blackmailer.

1475
01:47:42,541 --> 01:47:45,416
I summoned you here
to draw that very person out.

1476
01:47:46,041 --> 01:47:47,791
The accounting was masterful.

1477
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:52,791
A tangle of roots,
but all pointed to one pocket.

1478
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:57,375
One person
receiving the fruits of their schemes

1479
01:47:57,458 --> 01:47:58,750
with no one noticing.

1480
01:48:00,375 --> 01:48:03,416
Hearing everything, seeing everything.

1481
01:48:04,791 --> 01:48:06,833
Ignored for years.

1482
01:48:06,916 --> 01:48:08,333
Playing them all.

1483
01:48:09,708 --> 01:48:10,708
It's all a game.

1484
01:48:12,708 --> 01:48:15,750
And it's fun, once you know the rules.

1485
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:22,416
Miss Mira Troy.

1486
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:24,583
Absurd.

1487
01:48:25,541 --> 01:48:27,083
Oh, I don't believe it.

1488
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:32,125
It's remarkable
what can be done

1489
01:48:32,208 --> 01:48:35,875
when people underestimate you.

1490
01:48:37,208 --> 01:48:38,666
And then came the problem.

1491
01:48:39,875 --> 01:48:41,125
William stole the contract.

1492
01:48:41,208 --> 01:48:43,083
He threatened to cut off your money train.

1493
01:48:43,166 --> 01:48:44,541
And you couldn't have that.

1494
01:48:45,250 --> 01:48:47,708
You hired Grail to retrieve the document,

1495
01:48:48,666 --> 01:48:50,916
but things got out of hand,

1496
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,208
so you tried to point us to Lord McIntyre.

1497
01:48:54,208 --> 01:48:56,083
A rare misstep in your game...

1498
01:48:58,125 --> 01:48:59,166
Moriarty.

1499
01:49:06,291 --> 01:49:10,833
Such a shame our divertissement
has to end, Mr. Holmes.

1500
01:49:12,083 --> 01:49:16,208
I was so enjoying it.

1501
01:49:17,791 --> 01:49:20,416
And you, Enola.

1502
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:24,458
Miss Troy, you have been behind this?

1503
01:49:25,916 --> 01:49:29,333
Of course, you never can find
the proper staff.

1504
01:49:30,041 --> 01:49:31,750
I only wanted the agreements back.

1505
01:49:32,708 --> 01:49:35,333
Though I couldn't be seen
to question William myself,

1506
01:49:35,416 --> 01:49:37,291
you were so obliging.

1507
01:49:39,083 --> 01:49:43,166
If you wish to speak with William,
you could always try with that.

1508
01:49:46,875 --> 01:49:51,041
Just a pity he was smarter
and braver in the end than I'd expected.

1509
01:49:51,125 --> 01:49:55,666
They both were.
Their deaths were so unnecessary.

1510
01:49:56,291 --> 01:50:02,958
But Superintendent Grail
was somewhat of a blunt instrument.

1511
01:50:03,541 --> 01:50:04,958
You!

1512
01:50:05,041 --> 01:50:07,875
How dare you take advantage
of your position!

1513
01:50:10,833 --> 01:50:13,166
I take advantage?

1514
01:50:14,875 --> 01:50:17,583
What were my advantages?

1515
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,833
Treated like a common servant
when I have twice the mind of yours.

1516
01:50:24,958 --> 01:50:26,416
Any of yours.

1517
01:50:28,833 --> 01:50:32,625
Why shouldn't I have a share
of your ill-begotten riches

1518
01:50:32,708 --> 01:50:35,125
and punish you at the same time?

1519
01:50:36,208 --> 01:50:39,458
Why shouldn't I be rewarded
for what I can do?

1520
01:50:40,791 --> 01:50:46,041
Where is my place in this... society?

1521
01:50:46,750 --> 01:50:48,416
I am a woman.

1522
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:50,833
I cannot join clubs,

1523
01:50:51,500 --> 01:50:52,583
I cannot own shares,

1524
01:50:52,666 --> 01:50:55,583
I cannot advance myself as they can.

1525
01:50:56,791 --> 01:50:57,791
So...

1526
01:51:00,416 --> 01:51:03,000
I found my own way.

1527
01:51:05,375 --> 01:51:10,125
And it was fun.

1528
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:15,833
Lestrade,

1529
01:51:17,666 --> 01:51:19,666
take her away.

1530
01:51:19,750 --> 01:51:20,750
Yes, sir.

1531
01:51:23,041 --> 01:51:24,041
On what charge, sir?

1532
01:51:24,958 --> 01:51:26,833
- Extortion.
- Uh, yes, yes.

1533
01:51:26,916 --> 01:51:27,916
Blackmail, murder.

1534
01:51:28,750 --> 01:51:29,750
Go.

1535
01:51:30,083 --> 01:51:33,708
Such a shame our little dance has to end.

1536
01:51:35,041 --> 01:51:36,666
For now at least.

1537
01:51:36,750 --> 01:51:38,833
Perhaps we shall take to the floor again.

1538
01:51:47,083 --> 01:51:48,083
No!

1539
01:51:48,791 --> 01:51:50,208
No!

1540
01:51:52,041 --> 01:51:54,250
Well, there. That's that then.

1541
01:51:56,166 --> 01:51:59,166
I accidentally burnt my own property.
What of it?

1542
01:52:00,458 --> 01:52:03,041
You are corrupt, sir.

1543
01:52:03,125 --> 01:52:05,833
And complicit in the deaths
of hundreds of match girls.

1544
01:52:07,208 --> 01:52:08,500
Where is your proof?

1545
01:52:10,250 --> 01:52:11,291
Good.

1546
01:52:11,375 --> 01:52:14,958
So... back to business.

1547
01:52:16,291 --> 01:52:18,166
- Sir, you cannot...
- Tewkesbury.

1548
01:52:20,875 --> 01:52:21,875
Patience.

1549
01:52:28,833 --> 01:52:29,833
Glory be.

1550
01:52:41,916 --> 01:52:44,833
All those names, those lives,

1551
01:52:45,833 --> 01:52:46,916
I failed 'em, Enola.

1552
01:52:47,583 --> 01:52:48,708
Don't say that.

1553
01:52:50,458 --> 01:52:51,458
Mae gone...

1554
01:52:54,375 --> 01:52:55,375
William gone,

1555
01:52:56,791 --> 01:52:58,541
and they're gonna get away with it.

1556
01:52:59,750 --> 01:53:01,750
You heard the man. "Where's your proof?"

1557
01:53:03,291 --> 01:53:04,291
What do we have now?

1558
01:53:09,166 --> 01:53:10,375
We have each other...

1559
01:53:13,583 --> 01:53:15,166
and we have the truth.

1560
01:53:27,041 --> 01:53:29,875
You're late, Bess Chapman.
Docking you a penny.

1561
01:53:32,625 --> 01:53:33,625
Oi.

1562
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,625
You're not welcome here no more.

1563
01:53:38,208 --> 01:53:40,125
What are you doing? Oi!

1564
01:53:40,708 --> 01:53:41,708
Get down.

1565
01:53:42,250 --> 01:53:43,541
Get down!

1566
01:53:44,041 --> 01:53:45,750
Let her speak!

1567
01:53:49,833 --> 01:53:51,041
A few weeks ago,

1568
01:53:52,750 --> 01:53:55,666
Mae Izley, William Lyon, and I

1569
01:53:55,750 --> 01:53:57,375
set out to prove something.

1570
01:53:59,041 --> 01:54:01,333
To prove that this factory
was killing people,

1571
01:54:02,791 --> 01:54:03,958
and they knew it.

1572
01:54:04,041 --> 01:54:07,458
But they decided that profit
mattered more than we did.

1573
01:54:08,916 --> 01:54:11,166
- You're coming with me.
- Shh!

1574
01:54:11,250 --> 01:54:14,333
It ain't typhus that's killing us.
It's the phosphorus.

1575
01:54:15,041 --> 01:54:16,750
What we work with every day.

1576
01:54:17,750 --> 01:54:19,750
You lying little toerag.

1577
01:54:19,833 --> 01:54:21,375
That's a penny off your wages!

1578
01:54:23,750 --> 01:54:25,083
These were our friends...

1579
01:54:27,416 --> 01:54:28,500
our sisters...

1580
01:54:33,791 --> 01:54:35,083
and our children.

1581
01:54:36,875 --> 01:54:39,291
Well, it stops now.

1582
01:54:41,458 --> 01:54:44,625
It's time for us to use
the only thing we have. Ourselves.

1583
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:49,250
It's time for us to refuse to work.

1584
01:54:49,333 --> 01:54:51,000
It's time to tell 'em no.

1585
01:54:51,791 --> 01:54:53,666
- Right, get back to work.
- No!

1586
01:54:55,208 --> 01:54:57,625
You leave here, there is no coming back.

1587
01:54:59,125 --> 01:55:01,375
You will not get employed here again.

1588
01:55:02,875 --> 01:55:05,958
Well, will you join me?

1589
01:55:09,541 --> 01:55:11,000
Think of your families.

1590
01:55:11,833 --> 01:55:13,125
Don't do it, girls.

1591
01:55:13,208 --> 01:55:15,666
It is not worth the risk.

1592
01:55:16,375 --> 01:55:17,375
Well,

1593
01:55:18,916 --> 01:55:19,916
will ya?

1594
01:55:20,375 --> 01:55:22,416
This is how the world works.

1595
01:55:23,625 --> 01:55:24,458
Please, girls.

1596
01:55:26,333 --> 01:55:28,541
I know you're scared. I am too.

1597
01:55:28,625 --> 01:55:30,333
But it's the only power we have!

1598
01:55:37,791 --> 01:55:38,791
Right,

1599
01:55:40,416 --> 01:55:42,916
get that machine back on
and get back to work.

1600
01:55:49,833 --> 01:55:50,833
Right.

1601
01:55:54,166 --> 01:55:55,166
No.

1602
01:55:56,500 --> 01:55:58,000
This can't be their future.

1603
01:55:59,208 --> 01:56:00,208
I'm sorry, Enola.

1604
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,541
Stop that.

1605
01:56:19,083 --> 01:56:20,750
Stop that.

1606
01:56:25,958 --> 01:56:27,250
Be one voice.

1607
01:56:31,458 --> 01:56:33,541
That's enough!

1608
01:56:45,916 --> 01:56:46,916
Stop that!

1609
01:56:57,500 --> 01:56:59,541
Can't anyone control these bloody women?

1610
01:57:06,083 --> 01:57:07,083
Come on, girls.

1611
01:57:44,916 --> 01:57:47,375
- Where are you going?
- Westminster!

1612
01:57:50,083 --> 01:57:51,083
There they go.

1613
01:57:52,041 --> 01:57:53,500
That's a whole lot of noise.

1614
01:57:54,958 --> 01:57:56,916
She likes causing trouble, doesn't she?

1615
01:57:57,500 --> 01:57:59,958
It's as if she was molded that way.

1616
01:58:03,333 --> 01:58:04,916
She still needs that haircut.

1617
01:58:15,083 --> 01:58:17,458
Seems your boy has learned how to fight.

1618
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:20,916
Lord McIntyre.

1619
01:58:25,333 --> 01:58:26,333
Indeed.

1620
01:58:27,375 --> 01:58:28,375
He's not my boy.

1621
01:58:35,083 --> 01:58:36,583
"Pay what you can."

1622
01:58:37,291 --> 01:58:39,916
And what will people pay you in?
Potatoes and gratitude?

1623
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,333
If that's all they have.

1624
01:58:41,416 --> 01:58:44,541
You can deal with the hoits and toits.
This is where I should be.

1625
01:58:45,125 --> 01:58:47,125
Edith said she'll be kind with the rent.

1626
01:58:48,750 --> 01:58:54,291
You know, you are aware, should you wish
some finer surrounds, I could, uh...

1627
01:58:56,416 --> 01:58:57,416
I was thinking...

1628
01:59:00,250 --> 01:59:01,416
Holmes and Holmes?

1629
01:59:04,250 --> 01:59:05,250
A partnership?

1630
01:59:09,041 --> 01:59:11,041
That is the kindest offer.

1631
01:59:12,333 --> 01:59:15,458
But if I did that,
I would always be in your shadow.

1632
01:59:16,250 --> 01:59:17,458
Hm. Yes.

1633
01:59:21,833 --> 01:59:24,083
Though I do like this new version of you.

1634
01:59:24,875 --> 01:59:26,708
No one should be alone all the time.

1635
01:59:28,083 --> 01:59:29,375
A friend would do you well.

1636
01:59:31,875 --> 01:59:33,541
Perhaps I should write that down.

1637
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:39,375
I shall drop by to check on you.

1638
01:59:40,041 --> 01:59:41,125
I would like that.

1639
01:59:41,916 --> 01:59:45,125
Perhaps you could come to Baker Street
from time to time...

1640
01:59:47,208 --> 01:59:48,208
to check on me.

1641
01:59:52,416 --> 01:59:56,000
Perhaps we can fix on Thursday, 4 p.m.

1642
01:59:56,916 --> 01:59:58,166
Thursday at 4:00 it is.

1643
02:00:00,666 --> 02:00:03,416
It seems I shan't be the last
to interrupt you today.

1644
02:00:05,625 --> 02:00:06,625
And he has flowers.

1645
02:00:09,500 --> 02:00:11,666
- Sherlock.
- Tewkesbury.

1646
02:00:11,750 --> 02:00:14,041
- See you on Thursday.
- Bye, Sherlock.

1647
02:00:23,208 --> 02:00:24,375
- Sherlock?
- Yes.

1648
02:00:24,458 --> 02:00:25,458
Your paper.

1649
02:00:26,250 --> 02:00:27,250
Thank you.

1650
02:00:27,666 --> 02:00:28,666
And...

1651
02:00:30,125 --> 02:00:32,666
thank you... for everything.

1652
02:00:51,708 --> 02:00:54,708
Tewkesbury, when did I give you
the impression that I like flowers?

1653
02:00:54,791 --> 02:00:57,458
They're called Spreading Bellflowers.
Wild, of course.

1654
02:00:58,041 --> 02:01:00,791
Attracted to ancient woodland,
wiry, deceptive,

1655
02:01:01,458 --> 02:01:03,458
refuse to behave according to any rules,

1656
02:01:03,541 --> 02:01:07,958
but their petals are so delicate,
and their flowers...

1657
02:01:08,041 --> 02:01:09,041
Two things.

1658
02:01:09,083 --> 02:01:12,041
Your metaphor is tortured,
and I don't have delicate petals.

1659
02:01:12,125 --> 02:01:13,500
Oh, and, and, and...

1660
02:01:14,916 --> 02:01:18,166
It is an invitation to a ball
being given by...

1661
02:01:18,250 --> 02:01:22,333
Uh, I am not going to a ball with you.
I got arrested at the last one.

1662
02:01:23,666 --> 02:01:26,875
Well, all the more reason to dance again,
wouldn't you say?

1663
02:01:26,958 --> 02:01:30,083
- You're a nincompoop.
- And you are a coward.

1664
02:01:30,166 --> 02:01:33,041
How dare you speak to a lady
like that? You are a disgrace, sir.

1665
02:01:33,125 --> 02:01:35,250
And yet
you still hold my arm.

1666
02:01:36,041 --> 02:01:37,958
And yet I still hold your arm.

1667
02:02:18,250 --> 02:02:19,291
Sherlock Holmes?

1668
02:02:20,166 --> 02:02:21,291
Yes.

1669
02:02:22,166 --> 02:02:23,583
I'm here for my appointment.

1670
02:02:25,458 --> 02:02:26,498
You're seeking a flatmate?

1671
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,125
- You must have the wrong address.
- Really?

1672
02:02:32,958 --> 02:02:35,958
The young lady was very clear
as to the place a-and the time.

1673
02:02:37,208 --> 02:02:39,166
"Thursday at 4:00," she said.

1674
02:02:39,250 --> 02:02:41,000
- You are Sherlock Holmes?
- Hm.

1675
02:02:42,708 --> 02:02:43,708
Yes.

1676
02:02:44,791 --> 02:02:46,791
Please, do come in, Mr...?

1677
02:02:46,875 --> 02:02:47,875
Doctor.

1678
02:02:48,791 --> 02:02:49,791
Watson.

1679
02:02:50,500 --> 02:02:51,625
John Watson.
