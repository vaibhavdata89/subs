[door beeps]

00:00:14,787 --> 00:00:15,913
[woman] Thanks.

[doorknob rattling]

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,590
- No.
- [bangs door]

[sighs]

10
00:01:12,553 --> 00:01:14,680
- [gun cocking]
- Hands up. Hands up!

11
00:01:14,763 --> 00:01:17,474
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12
00:01:17,558 --> 00:01:19,351
Forgot all the cameras, bub?

13
00:01:19,434 --> 00:01:22,312
Look, Dr. Brenner asked for
me specifically. Okay?

14
00:01:22,396 --> 00:01:23,522
How else do you think I got in here?

15
00:01:23,605 --> 00:01:24,648
[Hopper scoffs]

16
00:01:25,315 --> 00:01:26,441
What's your name again?

17
00:01:26,525 --> 00:01:28,235
It's Jim Hopper.

18
00:01:28,318 --> 00:01:30,028
Chief Jim Hopper.

19
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,989
Yeah, I've got Jim Hopper... [grunts]

20
00:01:33,448 --> 00:01:35,033
- [man on radio] Come again?
- [grunts]

21
00:01:36,076 --> 00:01:37,578
[both panting]

22
00:01:37,661 --> 00:01:39,621
[indistinct radio chatter]

23
00:01:39,705 --> 00:01:41,290
Hey...

24
00:01:41,373 --> 00:01:42,875
you mind if I borrow this one?

25
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:45,294
- [beeps]
- [door buzzing]

26
00:01:49,089 --> 00:01:50,257
[door locks]

27
00:01:53,886 --> 00:01:56,263
- [liquid pouring]
- [Lonnie] Drink.

28
00:01:56,346 --> 00:01:57,639
It'll calm your nerves.

29
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:00,976
Help you think straight, yeah?

30
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:07,608
I don't know what to do.

31
00:02:08,984 --> 00:02:10,444
I know. I know.

32
00:02:11,862 --> 00:02:14,114
[sniffs] This whole time...

33
00:02:15,908 --> 00:02:19,453
I... I could... I could feel him.

34
00:02:19,536 --> 00:02:20,829
He was...

35
00:02:21,747 --> 00:02:23,916
He was so close. He
was... he was right there.

36
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:26,752
- I knew he was alive.
- [thunder rumbles]

37
00:02:26,835 --> 00:02:31,631
Our hands... our
hands were almost touching.

38
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:34,718
Now it's like I... uh...

39
00:02:36,261 --> 00:02:39,014
[sobbing] God, it's like
I can't feel him anymore.

40
00:02:40,766 --> 00:02:43,143
- Don't look at me like that.
- Like what?

41
00:02:43,227 --> 00:02:45,270
Like how everybody is looking at me.

42
00:02:45,354 --> 00:02:47,273
- Like I'm out of my damn mind.
- Hey.

43
00:02:50,192 --> 00:02:51,273
You're not gonna like this,

44
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:54,947
but I think you need to seriously consider
the possibility that all this...

45
00:02:57,282 --> 00:02:58,325
It's in your head.

46
00:02:58,408 --> 00:02:59,701
[scoffs]

47
00:03:00,827 --> 00:03:02,829
- You remember your Aunt Darlene?
- No.

48
00:03:02,913 --> 00:03:05,874
No, this is not that.

49
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:07,167
I mean, when something
like this happens,

50
00:03:07,251 --> 00:03:10,296
your mind makes up stuff
for you to cope, you know?

51
00:03:11,546 --> 00:03:13,799
I mean, Jesus, there's a
funeral tomorrow for our little boy

52
00:03:13,882 --> 00:03:15,801
and you're saying his body is fake.

53
00:03:17,052 --> 00:03:18,345
He's in the wall.

54
00:03:19,054 --> 00:03:21,014
I mean, how do you explain that?

55
00:03:22,891 --> 00:03:25,435
- [stammers]
- It just doesn't make sense. It doesn't.

56
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,231
- At least go talk to a shrink or...
- [sighs]

57
00:03:29,314 --> 00:03:32,359
- What about Pastor Charles or someone...
- I don't... Well, they can't help.

58
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:34,319
Joyce, you just told me...

59
00:03:35,237 --> 00:03:36,655
that Will is gone.

60
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,701
- What else is there to do?
- [sniffles]

61
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,248
Hey.

62
00:03:53,338 --> 00:03:54,381
[sniffles]

63
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,013
[Hopper] Will?

64
00:04:03,307 --> 00:04:04,475
Will?

65
00:04:06,768 --> 00:04:08,144
Will?

66
00:04:10,147 --> 00:04:11,315
Will?

67
00:04:31,752 --> 00:04:34,129
[Mike] What was Will saying?

68
00:04:34,212 --> 00:04:36,423
Like home... Like home...

69
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:39,301
but dark?

70
00:04:40,302 --> 00:04:41,637
[Lucas] And empty.

71
00:04:42,888 --> 00:04:47,184
[sighs] Empty and
cold. Wait, did he say cold?

72
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:50,353
I don't know. The stupid radio
kept going in and out.

73
00:04:50,437 --> 00:04:51,855
[sighs] It's like riddles in the dark.

74
00:04:51,938 --> 00:04:53,815
Like home. Like his house?

75
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:55,150
Or maybe like Hawkins.

76
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:56,776
Upside down.

77
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,112
- What'd she say?
- Upside down.

78
00:04:59,196 --> 00:05:00,739
- [Lucas] What?
- Upside down.

79
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,619
When El showed us where Will was, she
flipped the board over, remember?

80
00:05:05,702 --> 00:05:07,662
Upside down.

81
00:05:07,746 --> 00:05:09,373
Dark. Empty.

82
00:05:09,456 --> 00:05:11,792
Do you understand what
he's talking about?

83
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,794
- No.
- [Mike] Guys, come on, think about it.

84
00:05:13,877 --> 00:05:16,922
When El took us to find Will, she
took us to his house, right?

85
00:05:17,005 --> 00:05:18,799
Yeah. And he wasn't there.

86
00:05:18,882 --> 00:05:20,592
But what if he was there?

87
00:05:20,676 --> 00:05:22,636
What if we just couldn't see him?

88
00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:24,680
What if he was on the other side?

89
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:28,934
What if this is Hawkins and...

90
00:05:30,394 --> 00:05:31,604
this is where Will is?

91
00:05:31,686 --> 00:05:33,313
The Upside Down.

92
00:05:33,397 --> 00:05:35,107
Like the Vale of Shadows.

93
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:38,485
[Hopper] Will?

94
00:05:39,778 --> 00:05:42,072
- Will?
- [alarm blaring faintly]

95
00:05:45,283 --> 00:05:46,451
Will?

96
00:05:48,036 --> 00:05:49,830
[alarm continues]

97
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:56,294
- [pressing button]
- [indistinct chatter]

98
00:05:57,546 --> 00:05:59,214
[guards yelling]

99
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:04,136
I see him! Hey! Stop!

100
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,102
[Dustin] "The Vale of Shadows

101
00:06:12,185 --> 00:06:16,439
is a dimension that is a dark
reflection or echo of our world.

102
00:06:22,195 --> 00:06:25,490
It is a place of decay and death."

103
00:06:25,574 --> 00:06:26,908
[Hopper] Will?

104
00:06:26,992 --> 00:06:30,871
"A plane out of
phase. A place of monsters.

105
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,709
It is right next to you, and
you don't even see it."

106
00:06:35,792 --> 00:06:38,169
- [electricity crackling]
- [Hopper coughing] Will?

107
00:06:40,005 --> 00:06:41,340
Will?

108
00:06:41,423 --> 00:06:43,425
An alternate dimension.

109
00:06:44,426 --> 00:06:46,345
But... how... how do we get there?

110
00:06:46,428 --> 00:06:47,471
You cast Shadow Walk.

111
00:06:47,554 --> 00:06:48,847
In real life, dummy.

112
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,932
We can't shadow walk, but...

113
00:06:51,892 --> 00:06:53,310
maybe she can.

114
00:06:55,103 --> 00:06:57,772
Do you know how we get
there? To the Upside Down?

115
00:07:00,859 --> 00:07:02,527
[sighing] Oh, my God!

116
00:07:09,284 --> 00:07:11,161
[coughing]

117
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,207
[exclaims softly]

118
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,418
What the hell?

119
00:07:19,753 --> 00:07:21,421
[rhythmic pulsing]

120
00:07:45,487 --> 00:07:46,530
[gasps]

121
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:03,046
[Hopper] Hey!

122
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,132
Hey! Hey!

123
00:08:09,636 --> 00:08:11,638
[theme music playing]

124
00:08:50,408 --> 00:08:55,367


125
00:09:00,153 --> 00:09:07,300
_

126
00:09:22,751 --> 00:09:24,377
Hey, kid.

127
00:09:24,461 --> 00:09:26,254
What's going on?

128
00:09:26,338 --> 00:09:30,425
Your dad's, uh, gonna stay here
tonight. [stammers] On the couch.

129
00:09:30,508 --> 00:09:32,589
[Lonnie] Yeah, I'm here as
long as you need me, okay?

130
00:09:32,636 --> 00:09:34,429
How are you holding up?

131
00:09:38,016 --> 00:09:39,184
What happened?

132
00:09:39,267 --> 00:09:40,894
- Don't worry about that.
- Mom...

133
00:09:41,645 --> 00:09:44,606
that thing you saw
before, did it come back?

134
00:09:44,689 --> 00:09:47,400
Jonathan, that's enough.

135
00:09:47,484 --> 00:09:49,194
[sighs]

136
00:09:49,277 --> 00:09:50,904
Can we talk?

137
00:09:50,987 --> 00:09:52,155
Alone?

138
00:09:52,989 --> 00:09:55,200
- You need to leave.
- Look, I know you're upset.

139
00:09:55,283 --> 00:09:56,868
We all are.

140
00:09:56,952 --> 00:10:01,039
But you need to listen to me. Your
mother is sick. Really sick.

141
00:10:01,122 --> 00:10:02,624
Yeah. Well, you being here,

142
00:10:02,707 --> 00:10:03,917
you're just making
things worse, like always.

143
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,043
- Worse?
- Yeah!

144
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:07,086
She took down that wall with an ax.

145
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,255
She said that Will was
inside and that he's talking to her.

146
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:10,841
Yeah. Maybe he was.

147
00:10:10,924 --> 00:10:12,676
This isn't some kind of joke.

148
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,761
Your mom was half frozen
to death when I got here.

149
00:10:14,844 --> 00:10:16,220
Trembling, scared out of her mind.

150
00:10:16,304 --> 00:10:18,556
You come in here and you start
feeding into her hallucinations

151
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,808
or whatever the hell
you want to call it,

152
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:21,572
you're gonna push her
right over the edge.

153
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,853
You hear me?

154
00:10:26,147 --> 00:10:29,233
[sighs] Look, I'm on your side.

155
00:10:29,317 --> 00:10:30,610
I'm here to help.

156
00:10:31,528 --> 00:10:33,488
I'm gonna make things
better around here for all of us.

157
00:10:33,571 --> 00:10:36,282
[scoffs] Thank God you're here.

158
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:40,537
Do me a favor. At the
funeral tomorrow, just behave.

159
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:43,331
If not for me, for your mother.

160
00:10:47,335 --> 00:10:50,797
Take that down. It's inappropriate.

161
00:10:59,222 --> 00:11:01,683
- Good.
- Ah! Dad, you're... you're choking me.

162
00:11:01,766 --> 00:11:04,477
Ah... there. It's supposed
to be a little tight.

163
00:11:05,478 --> 00:11:06,646
Looks good.

164
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,107
- [zipper closing]
- Here we go. [sighs]

165
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:12,193
You look nice, sweetie.

166
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,531
Anything else?

167
00:11:16,614 --> 00:11:18,491
You can borrow my
black heels if you want.

168
00:11:18,575 --> 00:11:20,410
The ones you wore to Cathy's birthday.

169
00:11:20,493 --> 00:11:22,787
I'm fine. Thanks.

170
00:11:30,962 --> 00:11:32,338
[whimpering]

171
00:11:49,189 --> 00:11:50,482
Ugh.

172
00:12:04,788 --> 00:12:07,081
Come on. Time to go.

173
00:12:07,165 --> 00:12:08,666
[groans softly]

174
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:12,796
- Come on.
- [sighs]

175
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:17,759
[Pastor Charles] "Fear
not, for I am with you.

176
00:12:17,842 --> 00:12:20,512
Be not dismayed, for I am your God.

177
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,473
I will strengthen you.

178
00:12:23,556 --> 00:12:25,725
Yes, I will help you.

179
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:29,479
I will uphold you with
my righteous right hand."

180
00:12:30,855 --> 00:12:33,942
It's times like these that
our faith is challenged.

181
00:12:34,984 --> 00:12:37,570
How, if He is truly benevolent...

182
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:41,908
could God take from us someone
so young, so innocent?

183
00:12:43,243 --> 00:12:45,829
It would be easy to
turn away from God...

184
00:12:46,913 --> 00:12:49,165
but we must remember that nothing,

185
00:12:49,249 --> 00:12:51,876
not even tragedy, can
separate us from His love.

186
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,963
We are here today to find
comfort in the truth of scripture,

187
00:12:55,046 --> 00:12:57,298
- and to surround Will and his family...
- [sniffles]

188
00:12:57,382 --> 00:12:59,251
Just wait till we
tell Will that Jennifer

189
00:12:59,275 --> 00:13:00,742
Hayes was crying at his funeral.

190
00:13:00,802 --> 00:13:02,095
[shushes]

191
00:13:10,854 --> 00:13:13,940
- [Karen] I'm so, so sorry.
- Oh, thank you so much for coming.

192
00:13:14,023 --> 00:13:16,109
Yeah, if there's anything we can do...

193
00:13:16,192 --> 00:13:18,236
I appreciate it. Thank you so much.

194
00:13:19,737 --> 00:13:21,489
Take care, all right? Thanks.

195
00:13:22,532 --> 00:13:24,075
Thanks for coming out.

196
00:13:34,878 --> 00:13:37,130
I see Will the Wise is back.

197
00:13:39,007 --> 00:13:41,759
What's that shooting out of his cane?

198
00:13:41,843 --> 00:13:43,261
Fireballs.

199
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:45,638
I couldn't find the red
crayon, so that's why it's green.

200
00:13:45,722 --> 00:13:46,764
Oh, well...

201
00:13:46,848 --> 00:13:49,893
if he's so wise, why
does he need fireballs?

202
00:13:49,976 --> 00:13:53,187
Why can't he just, you
know, outsmart the bad guys?

203
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,899
Most of the time, yeah, totally.

204
00:13:55,982 --> 00:13:59,277
But... sometimes the
bad guys are smart, too.

205
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,361
You know?

206
00:14:00,904 --> 00:14:01,905
Yeah.

207
00:14:01,988 --> 00:14:03,948
So he needs the fireballs?

208
00:14:04,032 --> 00:14:06,826
Well, yeah, to burn them to a crisp.

209
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,329
All right. Well, I don't
know who's been raising you,

210
00:14:09,412 --> 00:14:11,831
but I'm gonna get you some new crayons

211
00:14:11,915 --> 00:14:14,834
because it looks like
he's shooting cabbages.

212
00:14:14,918 --> 00:14:16,169
[both chuckle]

213
00:14:20,048 --> 00:14:21,341
[gasping]

214
00:14:26,095 --> 00:14:27,805
[breathing heavily]

215
00:14:41,444 --> 00:14:42,946
[panting]

216
00:15:07,512 --> 00:15:09,347
[dishes clattering]

217
00:15:57,145 --> 00:15:58,479
[exclaims]

218
00:16:05,737 --> 00:16:07,614
[Lucas] Will! Will,
it's us! Are you there?

219
00:16:07,697 --> 00:16:09,137
[Dustin] Can you hear us? We're here!

220
00:16:09,157 --> 00:16:11,451
[Will distorted] Hello? Mom?

221
00:16:11,534 --> 00:16:14,328
- [Lucas] Why can't he hear us?
- [Mike] I don't know!

222
00:16:14,454 --> 00:16:16,748
[Will distorted] Mom, it's coming!

223
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:20,043
She was there.

224
00:16:20,126 --> 00:16:21,836
[church bell tolling]

225
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:24,672
This is where we know for
sure it's been, right?

226
00:16:24,756 --> 00:16:27,216
- So, that's...
- Steve's house.

227
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,844
And that's the woods where
they found Will's bike and...

228
00:16:29,927 --> 00:16:31,012
that's my house.

229
00:16:31,095 --> 00:16:33,973
- It's all so close.
- Yeah. Exactly.

230
00:16:34,057 --> 00:16:36,434
I mean, it's all within
a mile or something.

231
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:39,812
Whatever this thing is,
it's... it's not traveling far.

232
00:16:41,147 --> 00:16:42,815
You want to go out there.

233
00:16:43,358 --> 00:16:44,692
We might not find anything.

234
00:16:44,776 --> 00:16:46,110
I found something.

235
00:16:49,447 --> 00:16:51,991
And if we do see it...

236
00:16:54,327 --> 00:16:56,079
then what?

237
00:16:56,204 --> 00:16:57,246
[sighs]

238
00:16:59,457 --> 00:17:00,917
We kill it.

239
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:06,213
- What are you doing?
- Just give me a second.

240
00:17:14,889 --> 00:17:16,391
Are you serious?

241
00:17:16,474 --> 00:17:20,853
What? You want to find this thing
and take another photo? Yell at it?

242
00:17:23,398 --> 00:17:25,108
This is a terrible idea.

243
00:17:25,191 --> 00:17:27,735
Yeah, well, it's the best we've got.

244
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:30,739
What? You can tell someone, but
they're not gonna believe you.

245
00:17:30,822 --> 00:17:31,823
You know that.

246
00:17:31,906 --> 00:17:33,157
Your mom would.

247
00:17:33,241 --> 00:17:35,744
- She's been through enough.
- She deserves to know.

248
00:17:35,827 --> 00:17:37,203
Yeah, and I'll tell her...

249
00:17:37,286 --> 00:17:38,663
when this thing is dead.

250
00:17:43,209 --> 00:17:45,294
I don't know what in
the world caused it.

251
00:17:45,378 --> 00:17:47,547
- Let's take a look, huh?
- Yeah.

252
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,299
Mr. Clarke says he's never
seen anything like it.

253
00:17:50,383 --> 00:17:51,426
Mr. Clarke?

254
00:17:52,343 --> 00:17:54,428
Yeah, he runs the AV Club.

255
00:17:54,512 --> 00:17:55,638
[repairman] That right?

256
00:17:55,721 --> 00:17:59,099
Apparently, some of the less athletic
types go nuts for this stuff.

257
00:18:04,897 --> 00:18:06,399
[engine starting]

258
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,452
[indistinct chatter]

259
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:35,720
[Mike] Mr. Clarke?

260
00:18:35,803 --> 00:18:37,430
Oh, hey, there.

261
00:18:38,264 --> 00:18:39,640
How are you boys holding up?

262
00:18:39,724 --> 00:18:41,350
[munching]

263
00:18:41,434 --> 00:18:43,853
We're... in... mourning.

264
00:18:43,936 --> 00:18:46,689
Man, these aren't real Nilla Wafers.

265
00:18:46,772 --> 00:18:49,066
[Mike] We were
wondering if you had time to talk?

266
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:52,320
- We have some questions.
- A lot of questions.

267
00:18:52,403 --> 00:18:55,323
So, you know how in Cosmos, Carl Sagan
talks about other dimensions?

268
00:18:55,406 --> 00:18:56,532
Like, beyond our world?

269
00:18:56,616 --> 00:18:58,117
Yeah, sure. Theoretically.

270
00:18:58,201 --> 00:18:59,285
Right, theoretically.

271
00:18:59,368 --> 00:19:01,954
So, theoretically, how
do we travel there?

272
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:03,248
You guys have been thinking about

273
00:19:03,331 --> 00:19:05,491
Hugh Everett's Many-Worlds
Interpretation, haven't you?

274
00:19:07,627 --> 00:19:10,129
Well, basically, there
are parallel universes.

275
00:19:10,213 --> 00:19:11,631
Just like our world,

276
00:19:11,714 --> 00:19:14,175
but just infinite variations of it.

277
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:16,427
Which means there's a world out there

278
00:19:16,511 --> 00:19:18,095
where none of this tragic
stuff ever happened.

279
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,348
Yeah, that's not what
we're talking about.

280
00:19:20,431 --> 00:19:21,974
- Oh.
- We were thinking of more

281
00:19:22,058 --> 00:19:23,601
of an evil dimension, like
the Vale of Shadows.

282
00:19:23,684 --> 00:19:25,228
You know the Vale of Shadows?

283
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,730
An echo of the Material Plane,
where necrotic and shadow magic...

284
00:19:27,813 --> 00:19:28,814
[Mike] Yeah, exactly.

285
00:19:28,898 --> 00:19:31,275
If that did exist, a place
like the Vale of Shadows,

286
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:32,693
how would we travel there?

287
00:19:32,777 --> 00:19:34,654
- Theoretically.
- [Mr. Clarke] Well...

288
00:19:39,617 --> 00:19:42,203
Picture... an acrobat...

289
00:19:43,454 --> 00:19:44,664
standing on a tightrope.

290
00:19:44,747 --> 00:19:47,375
Now, the tightrope is our dimension.

291
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,919
And our dimension has rules.

292
00:19:50,002 --> 00:19:52,838
You can move forwards, or backwards.

293
00:19:53,381 --> 00:19:54,924
But, what if...

294
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:59,136
right next to our
acrobat, there is a flea?

295
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,348
Now, the flea can also travel back
and forth, just like the acrobat.

296
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,724
- Right?
- Right.

297
00:20:03,808 --> 00:20:06,102
Here's where things get
really interesting.

298
00:20:06,185 --> 00:20:08,479
The flea can also travel this way...

299
00:20:08,563 --> 00:20:10,690
along the side of the rope.

300
00:20:10,773 --> 00:20:12,400
He can even go...

301
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,569
underneath the rope.

302
00:20:14,652 --> 00:20:16,862
- [boys] Upside down.
- Exactly.

303
00:20:16,946 --> 00:20:19,198
But we're not the
flea, we're the acrobat.

304
00:20:19,282 --> 00:20:21,534
In this metaphor,
yes, we're the acrobat.

305
00:20:21,617 --> 00:20:23,202
So we can't go upside down?

306
00:20:23,286 --> 00:20:24,620
No.

307
00:20:24,704 --> 00:20:27,456
Well, is there any way for the
acrobat to get to the Upside Down?

308
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:31,127
Well... you'd have to
create a massive amount of energy.

309
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:34,005
More than humans are
currently capable of creating, mind you,

310
00:20:34,088 --> 00:20:36,382
to open up some kind of
tear in time and space,

311
00:20:36,465 --> 00:20:37,675
and then...

312
00:20:43,723 --> 00:20:44,932
you create a doorway.

313
00:20:45,016 --> 00:20:47,685
- Like a gate?
- Sure. Like a gate.

314
00:20:47,768 --> 00:20:50,563
- But again, this is all...
- Theoretical.

315
00:20:50,646 --> 00:20:53,107
But... but what if this
gate already existed?

316
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,610
Well, if it did, I... I think we'd know.

317
00:20:55,693 --> 00:20:56,986
It would disrupt gravity,

318
00:20:57,069 --> 00:20:59,030
the magnetic field, our environment.

319
00:20:59,113 --> 00:21:01,532
Heck, it might even swallow us up whole.

320
00:21:02,992 --> 00:21:04,327
Science is neat.

321
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:07,163
But I'm afraid it's not very forgiving.

322
00:21:18,674 --> 00:21:19,800
Whoa.

323
00:21:23,304 --> 00:21:24,388
Hey, Chief!

324
00:21:25,306 --> 00:21:27,099
- [knocking] Hello? Whoa!
- Hey!

325
00:21:28,768 --> 00:21:31,396
- [Powell] Jesus, Chief. You all right?
- What are you doing here?

326
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:35,149
- We tried calling, but...
- Yeah, the phone's dead.

327
00:21:36,734 --> 00:21:39,654
Hey, so Bev Mooney came
in this morning all upset.

328
00:21:39,737 --> 00:21:42,406
Said that Dale and
Henry went hunting yesterday...

329
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,532
and they didn't come back home.

330
00:21:43,616 --> 00:21:48,079
She thought they were on another
binger, but she's not so sure now.

331
00:21:49,288 --> 00:21:52,416
I think this whole Will Byers
thing has everybody on edge.

332
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,141
- Where was this?
- It was at the station.

333
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,129
No, no. Where did
Henry and Dale go hunting?

334
00:21:56,212 --> 00:21:58,089
Oh. Uh, out near Kerley.

335
00:21:58,589 --> 00:21:59,674
Mirkwood.

336
00:21:59,757 --> 00:22:01,008
What?

337
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:02,843
Okay.

338
00:22:02,927 --> 00:22:05,638
You go back to the station. I'll
take care of this, all right?

339
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,391
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, leave it.

340
00:22:08,474 --> 00:22:11,936
- Oh, hey. Uh, they found Barbara's car.
- What?

341
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:14,939
Barbara Holland's car. Seems
she ran away after all.

342
00:22:15,022 --> 00:22:17,566
Staties found it late last
night at a bus station.

343
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,694
Funny, right? They keep
doing our job for us.

344
00:22:22,446 --> 00:22:24,573
Yeah. [chuckles] It's funny.

345
00:22:26,534 --> 00:22:27,743
[door closes]

346
00:22:29,412 --> 00:22:31,705
- Is he off his meds again?
- [engine starts]

347
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:34,417
He's been spending too
much time with Joyce Byers.

348
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,751
That's what I think.

349
00:22:42,842 --> 00:22:44,885
[sighs] What are you doing?

350
00:22:44,969 --> 00:22:46,595
What does it look like I'm doing?

351
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:48,239
You want to freeze to death all winter?

352
00:22:48,973 --> 00:22:50,224
[hammering continues]

353
00:22:51,183 --> 00:22:55,437
- I told you not to take these down.
- They were in the way, babe.

354
00:22:55,521 --> 00:22:57,898
How long are you gonna
keep those up? I mean, really?

355
00:23:02,695 --> 00:23:05,239
You know, it's a shame what
they've done to this family.

356
00:23:05,322 --> 00:23:07,116
- What?
- The Sattler Company.

357
00:23:07,199 --> 00:23:08,909
I went to the quarry
on the way over here.

358
00:23:08,993 --> 00:23:10,995
I just wanted to look around, you know?

359
00:23:11,078 --> 00:23:13,581
Couldn't believe it. I
just couldn't believe it.

360
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:18,252
No warning signs, no fence, no nothing.

361
00:23:19,211 --> 00:23:21,380
Ought to be held
accountable if you ask me.

362
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:28,262
It would take a lot of
energy to build a gate like this.

363
00:23:28,345 --> 00:23:29,430
But that's got to be what happened.

364
00:23:29,513 --> 00:23:33,559
- Otherwise, how'd Will get there, right?
- Right.

365
00:23:33,642 --> 00:23:36,520
What we want to know is, do
you know where the gate is?

366
00:23:38,481 --> 00:23:40,357
Then how do you know
about the Upside Down?

367
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:49,408
[Mike] Dustin, what
are you doing? Dustin?

368
00:23:49,492 --> 00:23:50,743
- Dustin!
- Dustin!

369
00:23:51,785 --> 00:23:53,746
- I... I need to see your compasses.
- What?

370
00:23:53,829 --> 00:23:56,123
Your compasses. All of
your compasses, right now!

371
00:24:01,629 --> 00:24:03,214
What's exciting about this?

372
00:24:03,297 --> 00:24:06,800
- Well, they're all facing north, right?
- Yeah, so?

373
00:24:06,884 --> 00:24:08,765
- Well, that's not true north.
- What do you mean?

374
00:24:08,844 --> 00:24:11,931
I mean exactly what I just
said. That's not true north.

375
00:24:12,014 --> 00:24:14,350
Are you both seriously this dense?

376
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:20,564
The sun rises in the east, and
it sets in the west. Right?

377
00:24:20,648 --> 00:24:23,025
Which means that's true north.

378
00:24:23,108 --> 00:24:24,818
So what you're saying is
the compasses are broken.

379
00:24:24,902 --> 00:24:28,364
[sighs] Do you even
understand how a compass works?

380
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:30,699
- Do you see a battery pack on this?
- No.

381
00:24:30,783 --> 00:24:32,785
No, you don't. Because
it doesn't need one.

382
00:24:32,868 --> 00:24:35,663
The needle's naturally drawn to
the Earth's magnetic North Pole.

383
00:24:35,746 --> 00:24:37,164
So what's wrong with them?

384
00:24:37,248 --> 00:24:39,250
Well, that's what I couldn't
figure out, but then I remembered.

385
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:41,377
You can change the
direction of a compass with a magnet.

386
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,837
If there's the presence of a
more powerful magnetic field,

387
00:24:43,921 --> 00:24:45,631
the needle deflects to that power.

388
00:24:45,714 --> 00:24:47,394
And then I
remembered what Mr. Clarke said.

389
00:24:47,466 --> 00:24:49,134
The gate would have so much power...

390
00:24:49,218 --> 00:24:50,803
It could disrupt the
electromagnetic field.

391
00:24:50,886 --> 00:24:51,929
Exactly.

392
00:24:52,012 --> 00:24:54,390
Meaning, if we
follow the compasses' north...

393
00:24:54,473 --> 00:24:56,433
They should lead us to the gate.

394
00:25:26,338 --> 00:25:27,631
[sighs]

395
00:25:50,654 --> 00:25:51,989
Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, whoa.

396
00:25:52,072 --> 00:25:55,325
- [exhales] What are you doing here?
- What are you doing?

397
00:25:56,035 --> 00:25:58,996
- Nothing.
- I hope that's not meant for me.

398
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:00,456
What? No.

399
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:02,583
Oh, no, I was just...

400
00:26:03,542 --> 00:26:06,420
- thinking about joining softball.
- Oh.

401
00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:08,380
Well, uh...

402
00:26:08,464 --> 00:26:09,798
listen, I'm really sorry.

403
00:26:09,882 --> 00:26:12,635
I mean, even before you threatened
me with the baseball bat.

404
00:26:14,094 --> 00:26:15,471
Okay.

405
00:26:15,554 --> 00:26:17,056
I panicked and...

406
00:26:17,139 --> 00:26:18,223
[sighs]

407
00:26:18,307 --> 00:26:21,936
- I mean, I was a total dick.
- Yeah, you were.

408
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:23,437
[sighs]

409
00:26:25,481 --> 00:26:27,650
Did you get in trouble
with your parents?

410
00:26:27,733 --> 00:26:28,984
Totally, but...

411
00:26:29,068 --> 00:26:31,236
you know, who cares? Screw 'em.

412
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,155
Any news about Barbara?

413
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:37,201
- Parents heard from her? Or...
- No.

414
00:26:40,371 --> 00:26:41,372
Hey, listen.

415
00:26:41,455 --> 00:26:44,458
Why don't we, uh, why don't we
catch a movie tonight, you know?

416
00:26:44,541 --> 00:26:47,210
Just kinda pretend
everything's normal for a few hours.

417
00:26:47,294 --> 00:26:49,087
All The Right Moves is still playing.

418
00:26:50,005 --> 00:26:52,591
You know, with your lover boy
from Risky Business? [chuckles]

419
00:26:52,675 --> 00:26:53,717
Yeah, I know.

420
00:26:53,801 --> 00:26:55,469
You know, Carol thinks I
actually kinda look like him.

421
00:26:55,552 --> 00:26:57,304

00:27:07,523 --> 00:27:11,068

[inhales] with my brother.

427
00:27:13,362 --> 00:27:15,072
It's been really hard on him.

437
00:27:54,945 --> 00:27:56,739
- [Joyce] You were here for the money!
- [Lonnie] No!

438
00:27:56,822 --> 00:27:59,408
The money! Admit it!

439
00:27:59,491 --> 00:28:03,036
You aren't here 'cause of Will. You
never cared about him. You never did!

440
00:28:03,162 --> 00:28:06,415
Jesus, Joyce, it was his funeral
today. Do we have to do this right now?

441
00:28:06,498 --> 00:28:09,042
- I can't believe I fell for this.
- I'm here to help, Joyce.

442
00:28:09,126 --> 00:28:11,378
- To help?
- We could use that money for good.

443
00:28:11,462 --> 00:28:14,131
[stammering] Oh, like
maybe to pay off your debts?

444
00:28:14,214 --> 00:28:16,550
To pay for Jonathan to go to school!

445
00:28:16,633 --> 00:28:18,761
- Oh, don't do that.
- Do what?

446
00:28:18,844 --> 00:28:20,846
- Lie to me!
- I'm not lying to you!

447
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:22,330
Yeah, well, where does he wanna go?

448
00:28:22,389 --> 00:28:23,432
- Huh?
- What?

449
00:28:23,515 --> 00:28:25,156
Where does Jonathan want
to go to college?

450
00:28:25,184 --> 00:28:27,104
We get that money, anywhere
he damn well pleases!

451
00:28:27,186 --> 00:28:28,937
NYU, Lonnie!

452
00:28:29,021 --> 00:28:32,566
He's wanted to go to NYU since
he was six years old!

453
00:28:32,649 --> 00:28:34,943
So then he goes to NYU!

454
00:28:35,027 --> 00:28:36,195
Get out.

455
00:28:37,321 --> 00:28:38,739
Get out!

456
00:28:39,573 --> 00:28:40,824
You need me here, Joyce.

457
00:28:40,908 --> 00:28:44,536
[laughs] Oh, brother, I have
not needed you for a long time!

458
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,914
Oh, no? Look what happened.

459
00:28:47,623 --> 00:28:48,749
[scoffs]

Oh, don't you dare.

461
00:28:51,251 --> 00:28:53,712
- At least I was here!
- Oh, come on, Joyce.

462
00:28:53,796 --> 00:28:55,672
Just look around at this place.

463
00:28:55,756 --> 00:28:57,132
All your Christmas lights.

464
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:00,302
What the hell am I supposed to think?
You're such a great mom? You're a mess!

465
00:29:00,385 --> 00:29:03,597
Maybe I am a mess. Maybe I'm
crazy. Maybe I'm out of my mind!

466
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:08,685
But, God help me, I will keep these
lights up until the day I die

467
00:29:08,769 --> 00:29:11,480
if I think there's a chance
that Will's still out there!

468
00:29:13,023 --> 00:29:15,484
Now, get out!

469
00:29:16,068 --> 00:29:17,653
Get out of my house!

470
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,122

00:29:30,165 --> 00:29:32,793
[Nancy] You're
supposed to hit the cans, right?

472
00:29:34,378 --> 00:29:38,006
No, actually, you see the
spaces in between the cans?

473
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:39,967
I'm aiming for those.

474
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,093
Ah.

475
00:29:43,345 --> 00:29:44,930
You ever shot a gun before?

476
00:29:45,013 --> 00:29:47,891
- [scoffs] Have you met my parents?
- [chuckles softly]

477
00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:50,853
Yeah, I haven't shot
one since I was ten.

478
00:29:51,728 --> 00:29:54,356
My dad took me hunting on my birthday.

479
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:56,191
He made me kill a rabbit.

480
00:29:56,275 --> 00:29:58,068
- A rabbit?
- Yeah.

481
00:29:58,152 --> 00:30:01,864
I guess he thought it would make
me into more of a man or something.

482
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,283
I cried for a week.

483
00:30:04,366 --> 00:30:05,534
Jesus.

484
00:30:05,617 --> 00:30:07,870
What? I'm a fan of Thumper.

485
00:30:07,953 --> 00:30:11,248
[chuckles] I meant your dad.

486
00:30:11,331 --> 00:30:12,541
Yeah.

487
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,587
I guess he and my mother loved
each other at some point, but...

488
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,255
[gun cocks]

489
00:30:18,338 --> 00:30:20,007
I wasn't around for that part.

490
00:30:22,384 --> 00:30:23,552
Um, yeah.

491
00:30:24,595 --> 00:30:27,097
Just, uh, point and shoot.

492
00:30:29,641 --> 00:30:32,060
I don't think my
parents ever loved each other.

493
00:30:32,144 --> 00:30:34,104
They must've married for some reason.

494
00:30:34,188 --> 00:30:35,564
My mom was young.

495
00:30:36,523 --> 00:30:38,025
My dad was older,

496
00:30:38,108 --> 00:30:43,197
but he had a cushy job,
money, came from a good family.

497
00:30:44,823 --> 00:30:48,577
So they bought a nice house
at the end of the cul-de-sac...

498
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,621
and started their nuclear family.

499
00:30:51,705 --> 00:30:53,540
Screw that.

500
00:30:53,624 --> 00:30:54,791
Yeah.

501
00:30:56,168 --> 00:30:57,419
Screw that.

502
00:30:59,922 --> 00:31:02,383
- [beer can clatters]
- [both chuckle]

503
00:31:03,133 --> 00:31:04,635
[dialing]

504
00:31:05,969 --> 00:31:07,471
[line ringing]

505
00:31:10,015 --> 00:31:11,934
- [woman] Hello?
- Hey.

506
00:31:12,935 --> 00:31:14,519
Jim?

507
00:31:14,603 --> 00:31:16,355
- Yeah.
- [sighs]

508
00:31:16,438 --> 00:31:19,107
Why are you calling me
here? I told you not to call me.

509
00:31:19,191 --> 00:31:21,818
I know, I know, I
know. I just wanted to...

510
00:31:21,902 --> 00:31:24,279
I just wanted to hear
your voice and, uh...

511
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,492
I just wanted to say that, um...

512
00:31:32,955 --> 00:31:35,374
even after everything
that happened, I don't...

513
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:38,126
I don't regret any of it.

514
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:41,088
And those seven years, they
were... everything to me.

515
00:31:42,047 --> 00:31:43,632
Have you been drinking?

516
00:31:45,175 --> 00:31:46,426
No.

517
00:31:47,511 --> 00:31:49,680
- No.
- [baby crying over phone]

518
00:31:49,763 --> 00:31:51,890
[woman shushing] Honey, hey...

519
00:31:51,974 --> 00:31:55,060
Hey, it's okay... it's okay. [shushing]

520
00:31:55,143 --> 00:31:56,394
[crying continues]

521
00:31:56,478 --> 00:31:58,772
You know what, actually, I
have been drinking, I'm sorry.

522
00:31:58,855 --> 00:32:00,232
Jim, I can't...

523
00:32:00,315 --> 00:32:02,401
Just take care of yourself, okay?

524
00:32:02,484 --> 00:32:03,860
Say hi to Bill for me.

525
00:32:03,944 --> 00:32:05,237
Are you sure...

526
00:32:16,748 --> 00:32:19,001
[phone ringing]

527
00:32:23,171 --> 00:32:24,381
[ringing stops]

528
00:32:31,888 --> 00:32:34,099
[sighs] How much further?

529
00:32:35,142 --> 00:32:38,270
I don't know. These only
tell direction, not distance.

530
00:32:39,354 --> 00:32:41,565
You really need to learn
more about compasses.

531
00:32:41,648 --> 00:32:43,108
I'm just saying.

532
00:32:43,191 --> 00:32:45,610
How do we know when we get to the gate?

533
00:32:45,694 --> 00:32:49,364
Uh, I think a portal to another
dimension is gonna be pretty obvious.

534
00:32:50,365 --> 00:32:51,575
[sighs]

535
00:32:54,328 --> 00:32:55,871
Do you think she's acting weird?

536
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,541
You're asking if the
weirdo is acting weird?

537
00:33:00,876 --> 00:33:02,753
I mean, weirder than normal?

538
00:33:03,879 --> 00:33:05,464
I don't know. Who cares?

539
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,469
[breathing heavily]

540
00:33:14,598 --> 00:33:15,766
How far, Papa?

541
00:33:15,849 --> 00:33:18,101
Farther than we've ever gone before.

542
00:33:22,856 --> 00:33:24,483
- The bath?
- Yes.

543
00:33:25,525 --> 00:33:27,110
Yes, the bath.

544
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:31,907
Is that okay?

545
00:33:36,161 --> 00:33:37,204
Okay.

546
00:35:06,376 --> 00:35:07,419
Mike.

547
00:35:08,378 --> 00:35:09,880
Yeah?

548
00:35:09,963 --> 00:35:11,506
Turn back.

549
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,133
What? Why?

550
00:35:13,216 --> 00:35:14,301
I'm tired.

551
00:35:14,384 --> 00:35:18,179
[sighs] Look, I'm sure we're almost
there. Just hold on a little longer, okay?

552
00:35:26,396 --> 00:35:27,439
[sighs]

553
00:35:36,198 --> 00:35:37,991
[Nancy] You never
said what I was saying.

554
00:35:39,242 --> 00:35:40,452
[Jonathan] What?

555
00:35:40,535 --> 00:35:41,661
[Nancy] Yesterday.

556
00:35:41,745 --> 00:35:45,290
You said I was saying something and
that's why you took my picture.

557
00:35:45,373 --> 00:35:46,541
Oh, uh...

558
00:35:47,459 --> 00:35:48,710
I don't know.

559
00:35:51,129 --> 00:35:52,380
My guess...

560
00:35:54,382 --> 00:35:58,595
I saw this girl, you
know, trying to be someone else.

561
00:35:58,678 --> 00:36:01,139
But for that moment...

562
00:36:01,223 --> 00:36:03,683
it was like you were
alone, or you thought you were.

563
00:36:03,767 --> 00:36:06,144
And, you know, you
could just be yourself.

564
00:36:09,064 --> 00:36:11,942
That is such bullshit.

565
00:36:12,025 --> 00:36:13,401
[stammers] What?

566
00:36:14,819 --> 00:36:17,113
I am not trying to be someone else.

567
00:36:17,197 --> 00:36:19,699
Just because I'm dating
Steve and you don't like him...

568
00:36:19,783 --> 00:36:22,410
You know what? Forget it. I just
thought it was a good picture.

569
00:36:22,494 --> 00:36:24,496
He's actually a good guy.

570
00:36:24,579 --> 00:36:25,664
[stammers] Okay.

571
00:36:26,706 --> 00:36:29,042
Yesterday, with the camera...

572
00:36:30,043 --> 00:36:32,170
He's not like that at all.

573
00:36:32,254 --> 00:36:34,548
He was just being protective.

574
00:36:34,631 --> 00:36:36,466
Yeah, that's one word for it.

575
00:36:37,425 --> 00:36:39,386
Oh, and I guess what you did was okay?

576
00:36:39,469 --> 00:36:40,971
No, I... I never said that.

577
00:36:41,054 --> 00:36:42,264
He had every right to be pissed...

578
00:36:42,347 --> 00:36:44,391
Okay, all right. Does that
mean I have to like him?

579
00:36:44,474 --> 00:36:45,892
No.

580
00:36:45,976 --> 00:36:48,061
Listen, don't take it
so personally, okay?

581
00:36:48,144 --> 00:36:51,022
I don't like most people.
He's in the vast majority.

582
00:36:52,983 --> 00:36:56,111
You know, I was actually
starting to think that you were okay.

583
00:36:56,194 --> 00:36:58,029
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

584
00:36:58,113 --> 00:37:01,199
Yeah, I was thinking, "Jonathan Byers,

585
00:37:01,283 --> 00:37:04,494
maybe he's not the pretentious
creep everyone says he is."

586
00:37:04,578 --> 00:37:06,580
Well, I was just
starting to think you were okay.

587
00:37:06,663 --> 00:37:08,540
- Oh.
- I was thinking, "Nancy Wheeler,

588
00:37:08,623 --> 00:37:11,543
she's not just another suburban
girl who thinks she's rebelling

589
00:37:11,626 --> 00:37:14,546
by doing exactly what every
other suburban girl does...

590
00:37:14,629 --> 00:37:17,257
until that phase passes and they
marry some boring one-time jock

591
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,508
who now works sales,

592
00:37:18,592 --> 00:37:21,428
and they live out a perfectly boring little
life at the end of a cul-de-sac.

593
00:37:21,511 --> 00:37:24,848
Exactly like their parents, who
they thought were so depressing,

594
00:37:24,931 --> 00:37:26,933
but now, hey, they get it."

595
00:37:27,475 --> 00:37:28,518
[scoffs]

596
00:37:33,481 --> 00:37:34,482
[scoffs]

597
00:37:35,275 --> 00:37:36,359
[pounding on door]

598
00:37:37,444 --> 00:37:39,154
Go away, Lonnie.

599
00:37:39,237 --> 00:37:40,405
[continues pounding]

600
00:37:42,115 --> 00:37:43,158
Seriously!

601
00:37:44,075 --> 00:37:46,077
I am gonna murd...

602
00:37:48,455 --> 00:37:50,958
[whispers] What? What?

603
00:37:58,798 --> 00:38:00,091
[Hopper sighs]

604
00:38:01,801 --> 00:38:03,136
Oh, Jesus.

605
00:38:04,137 --> 00:38:05,764
[scoffs]

606
00:38:17,025 --> 00:38:18,652
Oh, no.

607
00:38:18,735 --> 00:38:21,529
"Oh, no"? What's, "Oh, no"?

608
00:38:21,613 --> 00:38:23,073
- We're headed back home.
- What?

609
00:38:23,156 --> 00:38:24,436
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

610
00:38:24,491 --> 00:38:26,826
Setting sun, right there. We
looped right back around.

611
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:29,454
And you're just realizing this now?

612
00:38:29,537 --> 00:38:32,457
- Why is this all on me?
- Because you're the compass genius!

613
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,042
What do yours say?

614
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:35,669
[both] North.

615
00:38:35,752 --> 00:38:38,213
- [Lucas sighs]
- Makes no damn sense.

616
00:38:38,296 --> 00:38:40,256
[sighs] Maybe the gate moved.

617
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,217
No, I don't think it's the gate.

618
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,136
I think it's something else
screwing with the compasses.

619
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,971
Maybe it's something here.

620
00:38:47,055 --> 00:38:49,474
No, it has to be like a super magnet.

621
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:51,226
It's not a magnet.

622
00:38:51,309 --> 00:38:53,228
She's been acting weirder than normal.

623
00:38:53,311 --> 00:38:56,147
If she can slam doors with her mind,
she can definitely screw up a compass.

624
00:38:56,231 --> 00:38:57,273
Why would she do that?

625
00:38:57,357 --> 00:38:59,317
Because she's trying to
sabotage our mission.

626
00:38:59,401 --> 00:39:00,735
Because she's a traitor!

627
00:39:02,862 --> 00:39:04,781
[Mike] Lucas, what are you doing?

628
00:39:06,449 --> 00:39:08,702
You did it, didn't you?

629
00:39:08,785 --> 00:39:10,578
You don't want us to reach the gate.

630
00:39:10,662 --> 00:39:12,497
You don't want us to find Will.

631
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,706
[Mike] Lucas, come on, seriously,

632
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:14,958
- just leave her alone!
- Admit it.

633
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:16,668
- No.
- Admit it!

634
00:39:17,752 --> 00:39:20,838
- Fresh blood. I knew it.
- Lucas, come on!

635
00:39:20,922 --> 00:39:24,008
I saw her wiping her nose on the
tracks! She was using her powers!

636
00:39:24,092 --> 00:39:25,885
Bull! That's old blood. Right, El?

637
00:39:27,429 --> 00:39:29,055
Right, El?

638
00:39:31,808 --> 00:39:33,727
[crying] It's... not...

639
00:39:35,311 --> 00:39:37,355
it's not safe.

640

641
00:39:57,292 --> 00:39:58,918
[panting] Okay.

642
00:39:59,002 --> 00:40:00,587
Should be okay, I mean...

643
00:40:01,546 --> 00:40:03,673
I can't guarantee it,
but it should be okay.

644
00:40:03,757 --> 00:40:05,425
What the hell is going on, Hopper?

645
00:40:05,508 --> 00:40:07,719
They bugged my place.

646
00:40:07,802 --> 00:40:09,137
- What?
- They bugged my place.

647
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,681
They put a microphone in the light.

648
00:40:12,849 --> 00:40:14,309
[sighs]

649
00:40:14,392 --> 00:40:17,020
It's because I'm on to
them and they know it.

650
00:40:17,103 --> 00:40:18,813
- I don't know...
- Who?

651
00:40:18,897 --> 00:40:20,273
I thought they might
be watching you, too.

652
00:40:20,356 --> 00:40:23,609
I don't know, the CIA, the NSA, Department
of Energy... I don't know.

653
00:40:23,693 --> 00:40:25,862
You gotta explain this
to me, 'cause I am not...

654
00:40:25,945 --> 00:40:28,990
I went to the morgue last night, Joyce.

655
00:40:30,408 --> 00:40:31,451
What?

656
00:40:32,076 --> 00:40:33,453
It wasn't him.

657
00:40:34,329 --> 00:40:35,371
What?

658
00:40:35,455 --> 00:40:37,582
Will's body, it was a fake.

659
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,170
[Joyce exclaims]

660
00:40:44,798 --> 00:40:46,257
You were right.

661
00:40:48,927 --> 00:40:50,929
This whole time, you were right.

662
00:40:56,434 --> 00:40:59,062
What did I tell you? She's been
playing us from the beginning!

663
00:40:59,145 --> 00:41:01,356
That's not true. She
helped us find Will!

664
00:41:01,439 --> 00:41:02,440
Find Will?

665
00:41:02,524 --> 00:41:03,775
Find Will?

666
00:41:03,858 --> 00:41:07,237
Where is he, then? Huh? I don't see him.

667
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,989
- Yeah, you know what I mean.
- No, I actually don't.

668
00:41:10,073 --> 00:41:11,324
Just think about it, Mike.

669
00:41:11,407 --> 00:41:14,077
She could've just told us
where the Upside Down was right away,

670
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,245
but she didn't.

671
00:41:15,328 --> 00:41:17,328
She just made us run around
like headless chickens.

672
00:41:17,372 --> 00:41:18,998
- All right, calm down!
- No!

673
00:41:19,082 --> 00:41:20,875
She used us, all of us!

674
00:41:20,959 --> 00:41:23,336
She helped just enough so
she could get what she wants.

675
00:41:23,419 --> 00:41:24,629
Food and a bed.

676
00:41:24,712 --> 00:41:26,923
- She's like a stray dog.
- Screw you, Lucas!

677
00:41:27,006 --> 00:41:29,008
No! Screw you, Mike. You're blind...

678
00:41:29,092 --> 00:41:31,453
blind because you like that a
girl's not grossed out by you.

679
00:41:31,469 --> 00:41:33,930
But wake up, man! Wake the hell up!

680
00:41:34,848 --> 00:41:36,057
She knows where Will is,

681
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,935
and now she's just letting
him die in the Upside Down.

682
00:41:39,018 --> 00:41:41,479
- Shut up!
- For all we know, it's her fault.

683
00:41:41,563 --> 00:41:42,605
Shut up.

684
00:41:42,689 --> 00:41:45,149
We're looking for some stupid monster...

685
00:41:45,233 --> 00:41:49,445
but did you ever stop to
think that maybe she's the monster?

686
00:41:50,572 --> 00:41:51,865
I said shut up!

00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:55,368

- [Dustin] Knock it off, you idiots.

689
00:41:55,451 --> 00:41:56,852
- Stop it!
- [Dustin] Mike, get off!

Lucas! Lucas! Lucas, are you all right?

694
00:42:10,258 --> 00:42:12,010
- Lucas.
- Lucas, come on!

695
00:42:12,093 --> 00:42:14,178
- Lucas, wake up! Lucas.
- [Dustin] Come on, Lucas!

696
00:42:14,262 --> 00:42:15,930
Why would you do that?

697
00:42:17,015 --> 00:42:18,735
- [Dustin] Come on.
- What's wrong with you?

698
00:42:19,309 --> 00:42:21,686
[distorted] What is wrong with you?

- Get off of me!
