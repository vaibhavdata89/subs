00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,162


1
00:00:01,982 --> 00:00:03,400
Nancy!

2
00:00:04,401 --> 00:00:05,944
Nancy!

3
00:00:06,027 --> 00:00:07,403
Come on, come on.

4
00:00:07,487 --> 00:00:09,072
Nancy!

5
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:12,283
Where are you?

6
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:15,412
Jonathan! Jonathan!

7
00:00:15,996 --> 00:00:17,581
Jonathan!

8
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:21,001
Jonathan, I'm right here!

9
00:00:21,668 --> 00:00:22,836
Nancy!

10
00:00:25,255 --> 00:00:26,381
Nancy!

11
00:00:27,257 --> 00:00:29,050
Jonathan, where are you?

12
00:00:29,134 --> 00:00:31,762
Jonathan!

13
00:00:31,845 --> 00:00:33,555
Jonathan!

14
00:00:33,638 --> 00:00:35,765
Jonathan, I'm right... I'm right here!

15
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:37,684
Where are you?

16
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:39,394
- I'm right here!
- Jonathan!

17
00:00:39,477 --> 00:00:41,855
I'm right here! Nancy!

18
00:00:41,938 --> 00:00:46,151
- Just follow my voice!
- Jonathan!

19
00:00:46,234 --> 00:00:49,487
Follow
my voice, Nancy, I'm right here!

20
00:00:53,408 --> 00:00:54,826
Nancy!

21
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:25,774
Nancy?

22
00:01:28,193 --> 00:01:29,361
Nancy.

23
00:01:31,613 --> 00:01:34,491
Nancy! Follow my voice!

24
00:01:40,163 --> 00:01:41,414
Nancy?

25
00:01:48,255 --> 00:01:49,923
- Jonathan!
- Nancy!

26
00:02:05,105 --> 00:02:08,150
I got you.

27
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:07,556


28
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:19,605
_

29
00:03:30,648 --> 00:03:32,400
I just don't understand why
we're coming out here.

30
00:03:32,484 --> 00:03:34,389
She obviously doesn't wanna talk to you.

31
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:35,761
That's... that's not it.

32
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,490
Oh, really? Because no girl would
ever blow off King Steve.

33
00:03:39,574 --> 00:03:42,243
She was acting weird. I
mean, something was wrong.

34
00:03:42,327 --> 00:03:44,248
So what?  Like,
you're worried about her?

35
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:47,749
- What?
- Aw, you are.

36
00:03:47,832 --> 00:03:50,543
- Aw, Steve has a heart.
- Would you just... Stop.

37
00:03:50,627 --> 00:03:52,212
- Oh, Stevey's in love.
- Would you just shut up?

38
00:03:52,295 --> 00:03:53,630
- Who knew?
- Shut up!

39
00:03:53,713 --> 00:03:55,048
Jeez.

40
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:59,052
Damn. Sorry.

41
00:04:04,015 --> 00:04:06,851
So this is it,
huh? Princess' castle.

42
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:10,605
I'll just be a minute.

43
00:04:41,553 --> 00:04:42,971
Look, we
gotta go through this again.

44
00:04:43,054 --> 00:04:45,849
- I told you everything that I saw.
- Oh, gosh. Tell me again.

45
00:04:45,932 --> 00:04:48,268
- Upstairs or downstairs?
- Upstairs.

46
00:04:48,351 --> 00:04:49,477
There was a laboratory.

47
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:52,147
It was where they must do
experiments or something, and then there was...

48
00:04:53,356 --> 00:04:54,774
There was this kid's room.

49
00:04:54,858 --> 00:04:58,528
- How do you know it was a kid's room?
- More like a prison.

50
00:04:58,611 --> 00:05:01,030
So why would you think it
was a kid's room, then?

51
00:05:01,114 --> 00:05:02,490
Because, I told you,

52
00:05:02,574 --> 00:05:04,184
the size of the
bed, there was a drawing,

53
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:05,334
there was a stuffed animal...

54
00:05:05,368 --> 00:05:06,995
You didn't
say there was a drawing.

55
00:05:07,078 --> 00:05:08,913
Yeah, there was a drawing
of a... an adult and a child.

56
00:05:08,997 --> 00:05:11,333
- It said "Eleven" on it.
- Was it good?

57
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,668
It was a kid's drawing,
Joyce. It was stick figures.

58
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:21,426
Wasn't Will.

59
00:05:30,393 --> 00:05:31,603
Earl...

60
00:05:33,354 --> 00:05:34,480
The night that Benny died,

61
00:05:34,564 --> 00:05:39,861
Earl said he saw some kid with
a shaved head with Benny.

62
00:05:39,944 --> 00:05:43,698
Now, I pressed him, he said
it might be Will, but maybe...

63
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:45,575
Wait... Maybe, it wasn't?

64
00:05:45,658 --> 00:05:47,994
Look... this woman, Terry Ives,

65
00:05:48,077 --> 00:05:50,163
she claims to have
lost her daughter, Jane.

66
00:05:50,246 --> 00:05:52,665
She sued Brenner, she
sued the government...

67
00:05:52,749 --> 00:05:55,126
Now, the claims came to
nothing, but what if...

68
00:05:56,878 --> 00:05:59,339
I mean, what if this
whole time I've been...

69
00:05:59,422 --> 00:06:01,090
I've been looking for Will...

70
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:04,135
I've been chasing after some other kid?

71
00:06:22,904 --> 00:06:23,905
Nancy!

72
00:06:42,382 --> 00:06:43,883
Better?

73
00:06:45,718 --> 00:06:46,844
Yeah.

74
00:06:48,554 --> 00:06:51,724
Is this okay? Uh, I
found it in the closet.

75
00:06:53,726 --> 00:06:55,407
I can go home.
I just figured...

76
00:06:55,436 --> 00:06:57,397
Yeah, no. I...

77
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,776
I don't wanna be alone.

78
00:07:02,694 --> 00:07:05,905
- Do you?
- No. Uh... no.

79
00:07:40,857 --> 00:07:42,859
Can you just come up here?

80
00:07:48,323 --> 00:07:49,449
Yeah.

81
00:08:01,044 --> 00:08:03,296
- Do you want the lights off, or...
- On.

82
00:08:04,505 --> 00:08:05,798
Yeah.

83
00:08:09,636 --> 00:08:11,012
You know, it...

84
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:13,848
it can't get us in here.

85
00:08:19,228 --> 00:08:20,813
We don't know that.

86
00:09:25,712 --> 00:09:29,341
Uh, yeah, it's Ives. Terry
Ives. That's with a "Y."

87
00:09:29,424 --> 00:09:32,343
Yeah, I got a pen. Hang on.

88
00:09:35,054 --> 00:09:36,305
Mmm-hmm.

89
00:09:37,557 --> 00:09:38,975
Mmm-hmm.

90
00:09:39,058 --> 00:09:42,228
Great, thanks. I really
appreciate this, Frank.

91
00:09:42,311 --> 00:09:44,313
Say hi to the boys
for me, too, would you?

92
00:09:51,696 --> 00:09:53,364
Did you get it?

93
00:09:53,448 --> 00:09:55,366
- I got it.
- Okay.

94
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,346
Oh...

95
00:10:18,347 --> 00:10:19,432
Hey.

96
00:10:20,808 --> 00:10:21,934
Hey.

97
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,146
Couldn't sleep?

98
00:10:28,983 --> 00:10:31,569
Every time I close my eyes, I just...

99
00:10:33,488 --> 00:10:36,199
keep seeing that... thing.

100
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:40,703
Wherever I was, that place...

101
00:10:41,788 --> 00:10:44,373
I think that it lives there.

102
00:10:44,457 --> 00:10:46,292
It was feeding there.

103
00:10:47,627 --> 00:10:49,420
Feeding on that deer.

104
00:10:50,505 --> 00:10:52,882
That means that if...

105
00:10:52,965 --> 00:10:55,384
if Will and Barbara...

106
00:10:59,305 --> 00:11:00,473
Hey.

107
00:11:01,098 --> 00:11:03,226
My mom said she talked to Will.

108
00:11:03,976 --> 00:11:06,646
If he's alive, there's
a chance Barbara is, too.

109
00:11:06,729 --> 00:11:08,731
That means that she's trapped...

110
00:11:09,357 --> 00:11:11,150
in that place.

111
00:11:15,112 --> 00:11:16,906
We have to find it again.

112
00:11:16,989 --> 00:11:18,950
You wanna go back out there?

113
00:11:19,492 --> 00:11:20,826
Maybe we don't have to.

114
00:11:21,494 --> 00:11:24,205
When I saw it, it was
feeding on that deer.

115
00:11:24,288 --> 00:11:27,416
- Meaning it's... it's a predator, right?
- Right.

116
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,587
And it seems to hunt at
night, like a... a lion or a coyote.

117
00:11:31,671 --> 00:11:33,381
But it doesn't hunt in packs like them.

118
00:11:34,298 --> 00:11:36,634
It's always alone, like...

119
00:11:37,718 --> 00:11:38,761
like a bear.

120
00:11:38,844 --> 00:11:42,181
And remember at
Steve's, when Barb cut herself?

121
00:11:42,265 --> 00:11:45,851
- And then, last night, the deer...
- Hmm, it was bleeding, too.

122
00:11:45,935 --> 00:11:47,144
One sec.

123
00:11:48,104 --> 00:11:50,606
Sharks can detect blood
in one part per million.

124
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,650
That's one drop of blood in a million,

125
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:54,986
and they can smell it from
a quarter mile away.

126
00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:57,738
So you're saying it can detect blood?

127
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,825
It's just a theory.

128
00:12:02,326 --> 00:12:03,828
We could test it.

129
00:12:06,163 --> 00:12:08,040
But if it works...

130
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,918
At least we'll know it's coming.

131
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:16,716
Honey, are you up?

132
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:19,302
Yeah, I'm... I'm getting dressed.

133
00:12:19,385 --> 00:12:21,929
I, uh, made some
blueberry pancakes.

134
00:12:22,013 --> 00:12:23,681
I'll be down in a second.

135
00:12:34,775 --> 00:12:37,236
Your mom doesn't knock?

136
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,752
- Hi. Scott Clarke?
- Uh, yes.

137
00:12:52,835 --> 00:12:54,879
The same Scott Clarke who
teaches science and AV

138
00:12:54,962 --> 00:12:56,130
- at Hawkins Middle?
- The very same.

139
00:12:56,213 --> 00:12:57,464
Oh, wonderful.

140
00:12:57,548 --> 00:13:01,052
And we're making a
newsletter, which we'll send out monthly.

141
00:13:01,135 --> 00:13:03,054
It'll showcase all the latest equipment,

142
00:13:03,137 --> 00:13:06,057
as well as how-to articles, which
the kids write themselves.

143
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,558
Oh, that's neat.

144
00:13:07,642 --> 00:13:09,227
What we're really
trying to do here, Mr. Clarke...

145
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,937
Uh, please, call me Scott.

146
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,563
Scott.

147
00:13:12,647 --> 00:13:16,567
What we're trying to do here, Scott, is
to connect kids from all over the state

148
00:13:16,651 --> 00:13:18,653
and give them the
support and encouragement

149
00:13:18,736 --> 00:13:20,738
to pursue careers in technology.

150
00:13:20,821 --> 00:13:23,532
We feel these are the kinds of kids
that are going to make Indiana proud.

151
00:13:23,616 --> 00:13:26,160
I agree, yes. Completely.

152
00:13:26,243 --> 00:13:29,246
So, you know any kids you
think might wanna participate?

153
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:32,041
Oh, I have a few in mind.

154
00:13:42,718 --> 00:13:45,513
I just... I can't
believe she didn't come back.

155
00:13:45,596 --> 00:13:47,598
- She's gotta be close.
- She said it wasn't safe.

156
00:13:47,682 --> 00:13:50,282
She just messed up the compasses
because she wanted to protect us.

157
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:52,478
- She didn't betray us.
- Mike, calm down.

158
00:13:52,561 --> 00:13:54,814
I shouldn't have yelled at
her. I never should've done that.

159
00:13:54,897 --> 00:13:57,483
- Mike, this isn't your fault.
- Yeah, it's Lucas'.

160
00:13:57,566 --> 00:13:58,687
It wasn't his fault, either.

161
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:01,862
- It wasn't his fault?
- No.

162
00:14:01,946 --> 00:14:03,656
So you're saying he
wasn't way out of line?

163
00:14:03,739 --> 00:14:05,282
- Totally, but so were you!
- What?

164
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:07,046
- And so was Eleven.
- Oh, give me a break!

165
00:14:07,118 --> 00:14:08,318
No, Mike, you give me a break!

166
00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:10,830
All three of you were
being a bunch of little assholes!

167
00:14:10,913 --> 00:14:12,456
I was the only reasonable one.

168
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,209
But the bottom line
is... you pushed first.

169
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:17,169
And you know the
rule. You draw first blood...

170
00:14:17,253 --> 00:14:19,005
No! No way! I'm not shaking his hand.

171
00:14:19,088 --> 00:14:20,688
- You're shaking his hand!
- No, I'm not.

172
00:14:20,715 --> 00:14:23,759
This isn't a
discussion. This is the rule of law.

173
00:14:23,843 --> 00:14:27,638
Obey or be banished from the
party. Do you wanna be banished?

174
00:14:28,264 --> 00:14:29,598
- No.
- Good.

175
00:14:32,018 --> 00:14:33,227
Where are we going?

176
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,604
Where do you think? We're
going to get Lucas.

177
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:37,606
And then we're gonna find Eleven.

178
00:14:53,581 --> 00:14:56,292
Today is a very special day.

179
00:14:57,835 --> 00:14:59,086
Do you know why?

180
00:15:02,048 --> 00:15:04,842
Because today, we make history.

181
00:15:05,885 --> 00:15:08,929
Today, we make contact.

182
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,608
Here you go.

183
00:16:02,691 --> 00:16:04,735
Ah... yum.

184
00:16:05,653 --> 00:16:08,155
Okay. Now, sweetie, swallow the pancake.

185
00:16:09,073 --> 00:16:11,283
Where is Nancy? I thought
she was coming down.

186
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:13,577
She is.

187
00:16:13,661 --> 00:16:16,705
Uh, she was. I don't know.

188
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:19,166
Nancy, what's taking so long?

189
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,876
Nancy?

190
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,629
Nancy, come on.

191
00:16:36,267 --> 00:16:37,810
Nan...

192
00:17:03,377 --> 00:17:04,795
What do you want?

193
00:17:09,383 --> 00:17:11,927
I drew first blood, so...

194
00:17:27,026 --> 00:17:29,028
Okay, I'll shake.

195
00:17:29,737 --> 00:17:30,946
On one condition.

196
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,073
We forget the weirdo and
go straight to the gate.

197
00:17:33,157 --> 00:17:34,575
- Then the deal's off.
- Fine!

198
00:17:34,658 --> 00:17:36,368
- Fine!
- No, no, not fine!

199
00:17:36,452 --> 00:17:37,745
Guys, seriously?

200
00:17:38,662 --> 00:17:41,081
Do you even remember what
happened on the Bloodstone Pass?

201
00:17:44,376 --> 00:17:48,005
We couldn't agree on what
path to take, so we split up the party

202
00:17:48,088 --> 00:17:50,007
and those trolls took us out one by one.

203
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,801
And it all went to shit.
And we were all disabled!

204
00:17:53,636 --> 00:17:55,763
So we stick together, no matter what!

205
00:17:55,846 --> 00:18:00,768
Yeah, I agree. But this is the
party, right here in this room.

206
00:18:00,851 --> 00:18:04,772
- El is one of us now.
- Um, no, she's not. Not even close!

207
00:18:04,855 --> 00:18:07,107
Never will be. She's
a liar, a traitor...

208
00:18:07,191 --> 00:18:08,984
She was just trying to keep us safe!

209
00:18:09,068 --> 00:18:10,611
She didn't mean to hurt
you. It was an accident!

210
00:18:10,694 --> 00:18:11,904
An accident?

211
00:18:11,987 --> 00:18:13,947
All right, accident or not...

212
00:18:14,031 --> 00:18:16,075
- admit it, it was a little awesome.
- Awesome?

213
00:18:16,158 --> 00:18:18,077
Yeah, she threw you in
the air with her mind!

214
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,870
I could have been killed!

215
00:18:19,954 --> 00:18:22,748
Which is exactly why we
need her. She's a weapon!

216
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:25,000
Do you seriously wanna fight the
Demogorgon with your wrist rocket?

217
00:18:25,084 --> 00:18:27,378
That's like R2-D2 going
to fight Darth Vader.

218
00:18:27,461 --> 00:18:29,338
We're no use to Will if we're dead.

219
00:18:30,297 --> 00:18:33,509
If you two wanna waste your
time looking for a traitor, go ahead,

220
00:18:33,592 --> 00:18:36,887
'cause I'm not spending my
time on her anymore. No way!

221
00:18:38,347 --> 00:18:41,350
I'm going to the
gate. I'm gonna find Will.

222
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,150
It's okay, Eleven.

223
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,682
Don't be frightened.
These are all friends.

224
00:19:23,142 --> 00:19:24,852
They're just here to watch.

225
00:19:26,937 --> 00:19:28,731
Don't focus on them.

226
00:19:28,814 --> 00:19:31,358
Stay in here, like before.

227
00:19:32,443 --> 00:19:34,028
Yes, Papa.

228
00:19:39,408 --> 00:19:42,494
Now, remember. Whatever
it is, it can't hurt you.

229
00:19:42,578 --> 00:19:46,165
Not from here. So there's
nothing to be frightened of.

230
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,376
It's reaching out to you...

231
00:19:50,294 --> 00:19:52,296
'cause it wants you.

232
00:19:52,379 --> 00:19:54,006
Hmm?

233
00:19:54,089 --> 00:19:55,299
It's calling you...

234
00:19:56,216 --> 00:19:58,135
so don't turn away from it this time.

235
00:19:59,053 --> 00:20:00,554
I want you to find it.

236
00:20:01,472 --> 00:20:02,723
Understand?

237
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,725
Yes.

238
00:20:39,385 --> 00:20:40,386
Are you lost?

239
00:20:43,972 --> 00:20:45,182
Is your mom here?

240
00:20:47,643 --> 00:20:48,852
Your dad?

241
00:20:51,271 --> 00:20:52,814
Mouth breather.

242
00:21:04,493 --> 00:21:06,954
- What should we do?
- Uh...

243
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:10,416
Call the police.

244
00:21:13,502 --> 00:21:17,464
Excuse me. Young lady! You
know you have to pay for those!

245
00:21:17,548 --> 00:21:19,258
Hey! Stop right...

246
00:21:19,341 --> 00:21:20,759
Please.

247
00:21:20,843 --> 00:21:22,928
You have to pay for those!

248
00:21:23,011 --> 00:21:25,514
Stop right there! Thief! Thief!

249
00:21:52,082 --> 00:21:53,125
Can I help you?

250
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:55,289
Hi, we're looking for Terry
Ives. Does she live here?

251
00:21:55,335 --> 00:21:58,297
- Who's asking?
- The Hawkins chief of police.

252
00:22:02,176 --> 00:22:05,012
And you want to talk to my sister?

253
00:22:05,095 --> 00:22:07,931
Well, if your sister's Terry
Ives, then, yeah, we do.

254
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:11,602
Okay, well, you can come in,

255
00:22:11,685 --> 00:22:13,812
but if you want
Terry to tell you anything,

256
00:22:13,896 --> 00:22:15,981
you're about five years too late.

257
00:22:18,567 --> 00:22:20,444
Terry, you have some visitors.

258
00:22:21,612 --> 00:22:25,073
Hello. My name's Joyce Byers.

259
00:22:25,157 --> 00:22:28,202
Uh, this is Hopper. We
drove over from Hawkins.

260
00:22:28,285 --> 00:22:31,663
Um, you see, uh, my son...

261
00:22:31,747 --> 00:22:35,000
he's been missing for almost a week now,

262
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:38,253
and, um, we were
wondering if we could talk to you

263
00:22:38,337 --> 00:22:39,963
about your daughter, Jane?

264
00:22:40,047 --> 00:22:44,051
If there's anything that you could
tell us about when she was taken...

265
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,845
What was your
relationship with Dr. Brenner?

266
00:22:47,846 --> 00:22:49,139
You guys keep in touch?

267
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:53,852
This is, uh... this is him.

268
00:22:53,936 --> 00:22:56,396
This is Will.

269
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,233
Uh, you may have seen
him on... on the news.

270
00:22:59,316 --> 00:23:01,568
- Uh...
- What's wrong with her?

271
00:23:01,652 --> 00:23:04,363
I told you, you're wasting your time.

272
00:23:40,691 --> 00:23:42,567
This is weird without Lucas.

273
00:23:42,651 --> 00:23:45,529
- He should've shaken my hand.
- He's just jealous.

274
00:23:46,154 --> 00:23:47,572
What are you talking about?

275
00:23:48,699 --> 00:23:52,202
Sometimes, your total obliviousness
just blows my mind.

276
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:56,081
He's your best friend, right?

277
00:23:56,164 --> 00:24:00,168
- Yeah... I mean, I don't know.
- It's fine. I get it.

278
00:24:00,252 --> 00:24:02,004
I didn't get here
until the fourth grade.

279
00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:03,780
He had the
advantage of living next door.

280
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:05,174
But none of that matters.

281
00:24:05,257 --> 00:24:07,926
What matters is that
he is your best friend.

282
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:10,346
And then this girl shows up and
starts living in your basement,

283
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:12,306
and all you ever want to
do is pay attention to her.

284
00:24:12,389 --> 00:24:14,892
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is. And you know it.

285
00:24:14,975 --> 00:24:17,561
And he knows it. But no
one ever says anything

286
00:24:17,644 --> 00:24:20,105
until you both start
punching and yelling at each other

287
00:24:20,188 --> 00:24:22,649
like goblins with
intelligence scores of zero.

288
00:24:22,733 --> 00:24:25,402
- Now everything's weird.
- He's not my best friend.

289
00:24:25,485 --> 00:24:29,156
- Yeah, right.
- I mean, he is, but so are you.

290
00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:31,658
- And so is Will.
- Can't have more than one best friend.

291
00:24:31,742 --> 00:24:33,452
- Says who?
- Says logic.

292
00:24:33,535 --> 00:24:37,122
Well, I call bull on your logic, because
you're my best friend, too.

293
00:24:38,123 --> 00:24:39,166
Okay.

294
00:24:43,795 --> 00:24:44,796
Whoa.

295
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,174
You don't think...

296
00:24:47,257 --> 00:24:49,676
Uh... definitely.

297
00:25:03,523 --> 00:25:04,858
Are you ready?

298
00:25:04,941 --> 00:25:07,694
She was a part
of some study in college.

299
00:25:07,778 --> 00:25:10,155
- MK Ultra?
- Yeah, that's the one.

300
00:25:10,238 --> 00:25:13,992
Was, uh, started in the '50s.

301
00:25:14,076 --> 00:25:15,494
By the time Terry got involved,

302
00:25:15,577 --> 00:25:18,789
it was supposed to be ramping
down, but the drugs just got crazier.

303
00:25:18,872 --> 00:25:20,415
Messed her up good.

304
00:25:20,499 --> 00:25:22,834
This was the CIA that ran this?

305
00:25:24,711 --> 00:25:28,548
You and Terry would've gotten
along. "The Man," with a big capital "M."

306
00:25:28,632 --> 00:25:30,092
They'd pay... you know,

307
00:25:30,175 --> 00:25:33,136
a couple hundred bucks to
people like my sister,

308
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:36,890
give 'em drugs,
psychedelics. LSD, mostly.

309
00:25:36,973 --> 00:25:40,768
And then they'd strip her naked and
put her in these isolation tanks.

310
00:25:40,852 --> 00:25:42,687
- Isolation tanks?
- Yeah.

311
00:25:42,771 --> 00:25:44,815
These big bathtubs, basically,

312
00:25:44,898 --> 00:25:47,526
filled with salt water, so
you can float around in there.

313
00:25:47,609 --> 00:25:50,278
You lose any sense of, uh...

314
00:25:50,362 --> 00:25:54,157
sense and feel nothing, see nothing.

315
00:25:54,241 --> 00:25:57,536
They wanted to expand the
boundaries of the mind.

316
00:25:57,619 --> 00:25:58,995
Real hippie crap.

317
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:01,665
I... I mean, it's not like they
were forcing her to do any of this stuff.

318
00:26:01,748 --> 00:26:02,999
The thing is, though, is that

319
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:05,168
she didn't know she was
pregnant at the time.

320
00:26:05,252 --> 00:26:06,753
Jane.

321
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,634
Do you have any pictures of her?

322
00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:17,722
I don't think you guys understand.

323
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,017
Terry miscarried in the third trimester.

324
00:26:26,314 --> 00:26:29,234
She keeps all of this up.
Been doing it for 12 years.

325
00:26:31,361 --> 00:26:35,323
Terry, uh, pretends like Jane is real,

326
00:26:35,407 --> 00:26:38,201
like she's gonna come home someday.

327
00:26:38,285 --> 00:26:42,748
Says she's special. Born
with "abilities."

328
00:26:44,082 --> 00:26:45,625
Abilities?

329
00:26:48,587 --> 00:26:50,297
You read any Stephen King?

330
00:26:55,594 --> 00:26:57,929
You guys look scared, actually.

331
00:26:58,013 --> 00:27:00,849
I mean,
it's all make-believe.

332
00:27:01,725 --> 00:27:03,768
What...
what kind of abilities?

333
00:27:03,852 --> 00:27:06,563
Telepathy, telekinesis...

334
00:27:08,356 --> 00:27:10,442
You know, shit you
can do with your mind.

335
00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:14,488
That's why the big,
bad Man stole Jane away.

336
00:27:14,571 --> 00:27:16,031
Papa!

337
00:27:16,114 --> 00:27:19,117
Her baby's a weapon, off
fighting the commies.

338
00:27:19,201 --> 00:27:23,371
You know, the doctors all
say it's a coping mechanism.

339
00:27:23,455 --> 00:27:25,165
You know, to deal with the guilt.

340
00:27:25,248 --> 00:27:28,210
Do you think there is any
chance she could be telling the truth?

341
00:27:29,336 --> 00:27:31,588
About having had the kid.

342
00:27:31,671 --> 00:27:34,466
There is no birth
certificate, nothing from the hospital.

343
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:37,636
Doctors and nurses all
confirm that she miscarried.

344
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:40,889
Yeah, but that could've
been covered up. Right?

345
00:27:41,598 --> 00:27:44,893
Like I said, you and
Terry would've gotten along.

346
00:28:06,915 --> 00:28:09,000
Oh, man.

347
00:28:58,675 --> 00:29:01,761
And I'll have four boxes of the .38s.

348
00:29:09,185 --> 00:29:11,646
What you kids doin' with all this?

349
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,064
Um...

350
00:29:15,984 --> 00:29:18,945
- Monster hunting.
- Huh.

351
00:29:22,073 --> 00:29:23,325
"Monster hunting"?

352
00:29:26,202 --> 00:29:27,704
You know, last week...

353
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:31,625
I was shopping for a new
top I thought Steve might like.

354
00:29:31,708 --> 00:29:33,543
It took me and Barb all weekend.

355
00:29:33,627 --> 00:29:37,505
It seemed like life or death,
you know? And... and now...

356
00:29:37,589 --> 00:29:40,133
You're shopping for bear
traps with Jonathan Byers.

357
00:29:41,051 --> 00:29:42,177
Yeah.

358
00:29:43,386 --> 00:29:44,679
What's the weirdest part?

359
00:29:45,597 --> 00:29:47,015
Me or the bear trap?

360
00:29:47,933 --> 00:29:50,268
You. It's definitely you.

361
00:29:51,853 --> 00:29:53,605
Hey, Nance!

362
00:29:54,481 --> 00:29:57,192
Can't wait to see your movie.

363
00:29:57,275 --> 00:29:58,652
What the hell was that?

364
00:30:00,111 --> 00:30:01,446
I don't know.

365
00:30:05,075 --> 00:30:06,201
What?

366
00:30:08,787 --> 00:30:10,413
What?

367
00:30:10,497 --> 00:30:12,082
Hey! Where are you going?

368
00:30:12,874 --> 00:30:16,419
Nancy, wait!

369
00:30:20,131 --> 00:30:21,299
Nancy!

370
00:30:28,431 --> 00:30:30,850
- I can't believe it.
- These kids!

371
00:30:31,893 --> 00:30:33,269
Jesus.

372
00:30:36,356 --> 00:30:37,691
Wow.

373
00:30:42,946 --> 00:30:43,989
Wait!

374
00:30:44,072 --> 00:30:45,657
Tommy, you write
like a three-year-old.

375
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,700
- Shut up!
- I didn't know you could spell.

376
00:30:54,874 --> 00:30:56,751
Aw, hey there, princess!

377
00:30:57,544 --> 00:30:59,421
Uh-oh! She looks upset.

378
00:31:01,881 --> 00:31:02,966
- Oh! 
- Damn!

379
00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:04,384
What is wrong with you?

380
00:31:04,467 --> 00:31:05,760
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with you?

381
00:31:05,844 --> 00:31:07,387
I was worried about you.

382
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,555
I can't believe that I was actually
worried about you.

383
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:12,892
- What are you talking about?
- I wouldn't lie if I were you.

384
00:31:12,976 --> 00:31:16,146
You don't want to be known as
the lying slut now, do you?

385
00:31:16,229 --> 00:31:17,439
Speak of the devil.

386
00:31:18,732 --> 00:31:19,774
Hi.

387
00:31:21,443 --> 00:31:22,610
You came by last night?

388
00:31:23,111 --> 00:31:26,197
Ding! Ding! Ding! Does she get a prize?

389
00:31:26,281 --> 00:31:29,034
Look, I don't know what you think
you saw, but it wasn't like that.

390
00:31:29,117 --> 00:31:32,495
What, you just let him
into your room to... study?

391
00:31:32,579 --> 00:31:35,165
Or for another pervy
photo session?

392
00:31:35,248 --> 00:31:36,791
- We were just...
- You were just what?

393
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:38,460
Finish that sentence.

394
00:31:40,587 --> 00:31:43,423
Finish the sentence.

395
00:31:50,013 --> 00:31:51,932
Go to hell, Nancy.

396
00:31:52,682 --> 00:31:54,142
Come on, Nancy, let's just leave.

397
00:31:54,225 --> 00:31:55,769
You know what, Byers? I'm
actually kind of impressed.

398
00:31:55,852 --> 00:31:57,395
I always took you for a
queer, but I guess you're just

399
00:31:57,479 --> 00:31:59,481
a little screw-up like your father.

400
00:31:59,564 --> 00:32:02,233
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah,
that house is full of screw-ups.

401
00:32:02,317 --> 00:32:03,818
You know, I guess I
shouldn't really be surprised.

402
00:32:03,902 --> 00:32:05,112
A bunch of screw-ups in your family.

403
00:32:05,195 --> 00:32:06,363
- Jonathan, leave it.
- I mean, your mom...

404
00:32:06,446 --> 00:32:08,281
I'm not even surprised what
happened to your brother.

405
00:32:08,364 --> 00:32:09,407
Steve, shut up!

406
00:32:09,491 --> 00:32:10,492
I'm sorry I have to
be the one to tell you,

407
00:32:10,575 --> 00:32:12,368
but the Byers, their family,
it's a disgrace to the entire...

408
00:32:16,331 --> 00:32:17,916
Steve!

409
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:19,667
Oh!

410
00:32:19,751 --> 00:32:21,336
Steve.

411
00:32:22,253 --> 00:32:24,172
Stop! Steve! Knock it off, you guys!

412
00:32:24,255 --> 00:32:26,415
- Get off of him, seriously!
- Kick his ass, man!

413
00:32:26,424 --> 00:32:28,424
Get off! Stop!

414
00:32:29,552 --> 00:32:31,152
Get in there, he's going
to hurt himself!

415
00:32:31,221 --> 00:32:33,974
Hey. Hey! Get out of here! Get
out of here! Get out of here!

416
00:32:37,936 --> 00:32:40,396
Jonathan, stop! Stop!
You're going to hurt him!

417
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,440
Jonathan, stop!

418
00:32:42,524 --> 00:32:44,684
- Cops!
- Guys... Jonathan, get off of him!

419
00:32:44,734 --> 00:32:46,903
- Stop it!
- Cops! Come on!

420
00:32:46,986 --> 00:32:48,905
- Stop it! Come on!
- Cops!

421
00:32:48,988 --> 00:32:51,157
- You have to stop!
- Just go, Carol!

422
00:32:51,241 --> 00:32:52,701
Stop it!

423
00:32:52,784 --> 00:32:54,410
Hey, he's had enough,
man! I said he's had enough!

424
00:32:54,494 --> 00:32:56,246
- Kids! All right!
- Stop it!

425
00:32:57,747 --> 00:32:59,332
Oh! My nose!

426
00:32:59,415 --> 00:33:01,208
Calm him down!

427
00:33:01,292 --> 00:33:03,878
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

428
00:33:03,962 --> 00:33:07,841
Hey! Hey, uh-uh. Uh-uh. Come
here, little guys! Come here!

429
00:33:07,924 --> 00:33:09,509
- Get off!
- I got this one!

430
00:33:09,592 --> 00:33:12,512
Get back here! Get
back here, you little punks!

431
00:33:19,144 --> 00:33:21,563
Good gift
for a college student...

432
00:33:27,601 --> 00:33:29,696
Well, thank you for
your time. We appreciate it.

433
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:31,979
Hmm, yeah, I'm sorry
I couldn't be of more help.

434
00:33:34,784 --> 00:33:37,120
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

435
00:33:44,836 --> 00:33:45,920
Hey...

436
00:33:47,005 --> 00:33:48,548
What?

437
00:33:49,215 --> 00:33:50,675
We're gonna find him.

438
00:33:52,802 --> 00:33:55,889
Yeah, like Terry found her daughter?

439
00:33:57,348 --> 00:33:58,766
We're close.

440
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:03,855
Twelve years? Twelve
years she's been looking for her...

441
00:34:03,938 --> 00:34:05,607
And then she shows up at
Benny's five nights ago,

442
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:06,931
which means we've got a chance.

443
00:34:06,983 --> 00:34:08,693
You know what I would give?

444
00:34:09,736 --> 00:34:11,988
For a chance?

445
00:34:12,071 --> 00:34:13,781
You know what I would give?

446
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,201
Hey, Chief, you there?

447
00:34:16,326 --> 00:34:18,494
- Hey, Chief?
- Yeah, go ahead.

448
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,371
Yeah, a fight broke out here and...

449
00:34:20,455 --> 00:34:23,666
- Cal, I don't have time for this.
- It's Jonathan Byers.

450
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,793
You haven't seen Joyce, have you?

451
00:34:38,306 --> 00:34:40,600
Do you think we'll be out of here soon?

452
00:34:40,683 --> 00:34:42,810
You, yes. Him, no.

453
00:34:42,894 --> 00:34:45,146
He assaulted a police officer.

454
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,482
Well, how long are you gonna keep him?

455
00:34:47,565 --> 00:34:49,734
You and your boyfriend
have big plans, do you?

456
00:34:49,817 --> 00:34:52,028
He's not my boyfriend.

457
00:34:52,111 --> 00:34:54,614
I think you better tell him that.

458
00:34:55,323 --> 00:34:56,366
What?

459
00:34:56,449 --> 00:34:59,202
Only love makes you
that crazy, sweetheart.

460
00:35:00,245 --> 00:35:02,121
And that damn stupid.

461
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,965
Found some ice.

462
00:35:14,342 --> 00:35:15,510
Thanks.

463
00:35:29,274 --> 00:35:30,608
Everything okay?

464
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,486
Yeah.

465
00:35:34,612 --> 00:35:36,197
Everything's fine.

466
00:35:49,294 --> 00:35:51,129
El!

467
00:35:53,298 --> 00:35:55,049
Eleven!

468
00:35:57,593 --> 00:36:00,388
- Eleven! El!
- El!

469
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:03,266
Eleven!

470
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:04,559
Eleven!

471
00:36:07,562 --> 00:36:10,440
- Hey, stop. Do you hear that?
- What?

472
00:36:10,523 --> 00:36:11,607
El!

473
00:36:12,608 --> 00:36:13,651
El?

474
00:36:18,156 --> 00:36:19,449
Hey, there, Frogface.

475
00:36:20,366 --> 00:36:21,409
Toothless.

476
00:36:21,492 --> 00:36:23,369
Shit! Run, Mike!

477
00:36:23,453 --> 00:36:25,496
- What?
- Run! Come on!

478
00:36:26,331 --> 00:36:27,749
You're dead, Wheeler.

479
00:36:27,832 --> 00:36:29,542
Move, Mike!

480
00:36:29,625 --> 00:36:31,210
Mike, come on, run!

481
00:37:48,413 --> 00:37:50,373
Cramp!

482
00:37:50,456 --> 00:37:52,125
Just keep going!

483
00:37:52,208 --> 00:37:53,376
Keep going!

484
00:37:59,507 --> 00:38:00,967
Shit!

485
00:38:02,677 --> 00:38:04,846
- Stay back!
- Don't come any closer!

486
00:38:07,432 --> 00:38:10,059
Nice throw, numbnuts.

487
00:38:13,396 --> 00:38:15,064
Get off! Get off me!

488
00:38:15,148 --> 00:38:17,024
Let him go! Let him go!

489
00:38:17,108 --> 00:38:20,069
- Stay back, or I cut him!
- What do you want?

490
00:38:20,153 --> 00:38:21,363
I want to know how you did it!

491
00:38:21,446 --> 00:38:22,807
How I did what?

492
00:38:22,822 --> 00:38:24,115
I know you did something to me.

493
00:38:24,198 --> 00:38:26,075
Some nerdy science
shit to make me do that.

494
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,410
You mean piss your pants?

495
00:38:28,494 --> 00:38:30,079
Our friend has superpowers,

496
00:38:30,163 --> 00:38:32,582
and she squeezed your
tiny bladder with her mind.

497
00:38:32,665 --> 00:38:34,041
Shut up!

498
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:36,461
I think I should save Toothless
here a trip to the dentist.

499
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,254
Help him lose the
rest of his baby teeth.

500
00:38:38,337 --> 00:38:40,173
Let him go. Let him go!

501
00:38:40,256 --> 00:38:42,467
I'll let him go, sure.

502
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,844
But first... it's your turn.

503
00:38:44,927 --> 00:38:46,053
My turn for what?

504
00:38:46,137 --> 00:38:47,763
Wet yourself.

505
00:38:48,598 --> 00:38:50,600
- What?
- Jump...

506
00:38:50,683 --> 00:38:53,144
or Toothless here gets an
early trip to the dentist.

507
00:38:53,227 --> 00:38:54,562
Stop! No!

508
00:38:59,192 --> 00:39:00,359
I'll cut him right now!

509
00:39:02,862 --> 00:39:05,323
All right, just hold on! Hold on!

510
00:39:05,406 --> 00:39:07,742
Mike, don't do it. I don't
need my baby teeth, Mike!

511
00:39:07,825 --> 00:39:09,702
Mike, seriously, don't!

512
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,472
Mike, don't do it!

513
00:39:29,555 --> 00:39:32,391
Seriously, don't do it,
man! Seriously, don't!

514
00:39:32,475 --> 00:39:34,352
Troy, I don't think this
is a good idea, man.

515
00:39:35,228 --> 00:39:36,812
Mike, don't!

516
00:39:36,896 --> 00:39:40,525
Dentist's office opens in five...

517
00:39:40,608 --> 00:39:43,027
Four! Three!

518
00:39:44,779 --> 00:39:46,906
- Two!
- Mike!

519
00:39:46,989 --> 00:39:47,990
One!

520
00:39:57,542 --> 00:39:58,751
Holy shit.

521
00:40:08,803 --> 00:40:11,722
Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

522
00:40:40,126 --> 00:40:42,503
She broke my arm! My arm!

523
00:40:42,587 --> 00:40:43,630
Go.

524
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:46,872
Let's get out of here! Let's go!

525
00:40:46,897 --> 00:40:47,574
Go!

526
00:40:47,633 --> 00:40:49,552
Yeah, that's right! You better run!

527
00:40:50,303 --> 00:40:52,763
She's our friend and she's crazy!

528
00:40:52,847 --> 00:40:55,224
You come back here and she'll kill you!

529
00:40:55,308 --> 00:40:59,270
You hear me? She'll kill
you, you sons of bitches!

530
00:40:59,353 --> 00:41:01,397
She'll kill you, you hear me?

531
00:42:17,473 --> 00:42:18,808
El, are you okay?

532
00:42:18,891 --> 00:42:20,476
El?

533
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:24,313
Mike... I'm sorry.

534
00:42:24,397 --> 00:42:26,857
Sorry? What are you sorry for?

535
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,318
The gate...

536
00:42:33,197 --> 00:42:34,615
I opened it.

537
00:42:38,285 --> 00:42:39,704
I'm the monster.

538
00:42:41,122 --> 00:42:43,791
No. No, El, you're not the monster.

539
00:42:43,874 --> 00:42:45,459
You saved me.

540
00:42:45,543 --> 00:42:48,421
Do you understand? You saved me.

541
00:43:28,294 --> 00:43:31,964
I have eyes on 'em
now. They're heading home.

542
00:44:19,933 --> 00:44:24,969
