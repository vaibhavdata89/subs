00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,162

﻿1
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:05,971
That's better.

2
00:00:13,645 --> 00:00:15,230
You don't need it.

3
00:00:18,107 --> 00:00:19,525
Still pretty?

4
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:21,402
Yeah!

5
00:00:21,486 --> 00:00:23,363
Pretty. Really pretty.

6
00:00:29,702 --> 00:00:30,703
El?

7
00:00:31,871 --> 00:00:32,997
Yes?

8
00:00:34,165 --> 00:00:37,252
Um, I'm happy you're home.

9
00:00:38,086 --> 00:00:39,837
Me, too.

10
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:47,971
Guys!

11
00:00:48,054 --> 00:00:49,855
It's Lucas, I
think he's in trouble.

12
00:00:51,683 --> 00:00:53,560
Do you remember how he said
he was looking for the gate?

13
00:00:53,643 --> 00:00:55,228
- Yeah.
- What if he found it?

14
00:00:58,314 --> 00:00:59,357
What's he saying?

15
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,484
I don't know, he's way out of range.

16
00:01:02,193 --> 00:01:03,528
...son of a bitch!

17
00:01:03,611 --> 00:01:06,739
Lucas, if you can hear us, slow
down. We can't understand you.

18
00:01:06,823 --> 00:01:09,409
Yes, I copy! Do you?

19
00:01:09,492 --> 00:01:11,244
They know about Eleven!

20
00:01:11,327 --> 00:01:13,371
Get out of there! They
know about Eleven!

21
00:01:13,454 --> 00:01:15,957
The bad men are coming! All of them!

22
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,709
Do you hear me? The bad men are coming!

23
00:01:18,793 --> 00:01:20,461
"Mad hen." Does that
mean anything to you?

24
00:01:20,545 --> 00:01:21,880
Like a code name or something?

25
00:01:21,963 --> 00:01:24,424
- The bad men are coming!
- "Bad men."

26
00:01:24,507 --> 00:01:26,134
Bad men!

27
00:01:26,217 --> 00:01:28,136
Stay here.

28
00:01:37,437 --> 00:01:38,730
What's that guy doing?

29
00:01:38,813 --> 00:01:40,732
You don't think...

30
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:44,986
Well, I know she and Steve have
been spending some time together,

31
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:46,237
- so I thought maybe...
- Mom!

32
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:48,114
Well, is he home?

33
00:01:48,197 --> 00:01:49,240
- Maybe you could ask him?
- Mom!

34
00:01:49,324 --> 00:01:50,617
I'm sorry, can you just hold on, please?

35
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,827
Michael, I'm on the phone. I've
told you a million times...

36
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,829
- Did you schedule any repairs?
- What?

37
00:01:54,912 --> 00:01:57,582
Is there anyone supposed to
come and do repairs on the house?

38
00:02:08,051 --> 00:02:09,302
I don't understand. Is
there something wrong...

39
00:02:09,385 --> 00:02:11,638
- No, Mom, nothing's wrong in the house.
- Mike!

40
00:02:11,721 --> 00:02:13,681
- One second.
- Mike!

41
00:02:13,765 --> 00:02:17,685
We need to leave...  right now.

42
00:02:19,687 --> 00:02:21,731
Michael!

43
00:02:22,482 --> 00:02:25,610
If anyone asks where I
am, I've left the country.

44
00:02:25,693 --> 00:02:26,778
What?

45
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:54,514
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

46
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:06,359
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

47
00:03:06,442 --> 00:03:08,883
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Dustin!

48
00:03:08,903 --> 00:03:10,780
Dustin, do you copy?

49
00:03:10,863 --> 00:03:12,698
Yeah, Lucas, they're on us.

50
00:03:12,782 --> 00:03:14,409
- Where are you?
- Cornwallis.

51
00:03:14,492 --> 00:03:15,785
Meet me at Elm and Cherry!

52
00:03:15,868 --> 00:03:17,495
Copy. Elm and Cherry!

53
00:03:17,578 --> 00:03:18,788
Okay.

54
00:03:26,421 --> 00:03:28,214
- Shit!
- This way, come on!

55
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:34,595
Out of the way!

56
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:36,305
Out of the way!

57
00:03:43,855 --> 00:03:45,055
- Lucas!
- Where are they?

58
00:03:45,106 --> 00:03:46,399
- I don't know.
- I think we lost them.

59
00:03:46,482 --> 00:03:48,943
Go, go, go, go, go!

60
00:03:51,446 --> 00:03:53,114
Go, go, go, go, go!

61
00:03:53,197 --> 00:03:55,533
- Faster, faster!
- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

62
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:48,127
Holy... holy shit!

63
00:04:48,211 --> 00:04:50,588
Did... did you see what
she did to that van?

64
00:04:50,671 --> 00:04:51,755
No, Dustin, we missed it.

65
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,342
- I mean that was...
- Awesome.

66
00:04:56,427 --> 00:04:58,095
It was awesome.

67
00:05:04,977 --> 00:05:08,815
Everything I said about you
being a traitor and stuff...

68
00:05:10,107 --> 00:05:11,526
I was wrong.

69
00:05:14,862 --> 00:05:16,364
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,078
Friends...

71
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:24,872
friends don't lie.

72
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,085
I'm sorry, too.

73
00:05:30,586 --> 00:05:31,629
Me, too.

74
00:06:25,854 --> 00:06:30,239


75
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:41,476
_

76
00:07:02,094 --> 00:07:03,137
Hey.

77
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,681
Jonathan? Jesus, what... what happened?

78
00:07:05,765 --> 00:07:06,966
- Ma'am...
- I'm fine.

79
00:07:07,016 --> 00:07:08,476
Why is he wearing handcuffs?

80
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:10,686
Well, your boy assaulted a
police officer. That's why.

81
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,064
- Take them off.
- I am afraid I cannot do that.

82
00:07:13,147 --> 00:07:15,232
- Take them off!
- You heard her. Take 'em off.

83
00:07:15,316 --> 00:07:20,780
Chief, I get everyone's emotional
here, but there's something you need to see.

84
00:07:27,703 --> 00:07:28,787
What is this?

85
00:07:28,871 --> 00:07:30,456
Why don't you ask your
son? We found it in his car.

86
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,220
- What?
- Why are you going through my car?

87
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:34,042
Is that really the question you
should be asking right now?

88
00:07:34,543 --> 00:07:36,212
I wanna see you in my office.

89
00:07:36,295 --> 00:07:37,630
You won't believe me.

90
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,717
Why don't you give me a try?

91
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,513
Mike? Mike?

92
00:08:06,701 --> 00:08:08,828
Yeah, just a minute, please!

93
00:08:09,745 --> 00:08:12,581
Jiminy Christmas.

94
00:08:13,499 --> 00:08:14,959
Hold your horses.

95
00:08:18,963 --> 00:08:20,006
Mr. Wheeler?

96
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:21,716
Yes?

97
00:09:03,174 --> 00:09:05,551
I don't understand.

98
00:09:05,634 --> 00:09:08,012
You think my son is hiding this girl?

99
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,221
What happened to her hair?

100
00:09:09,305 --> 00:09:11,849
We just need to know if you've
seen her in the past week.

101
00:09:11,932 --> 00:09:15,144
- No, no.
- Absolutely not.

102
00:09:15,227 --> 00:09:16,937
Our son with a girl?

103
00:09:17,021 --> 00:09:19,315
I mean, believe me,

104
00:09:19,398 --> 00:09:22,735
if he had a girl sleeping in
this house, we'd know about it.

105
00:09:22,818 --> 00:09:24,403
Wouldn't we?

106
00:09:25,571 --> 00:09:27,323
This girl...

107
00:09:27,406 --> 00:09:28,449
what has she done?

108
00:09:28,532 --> 00:09:30,284
I'm afraid I can't answer that.

109
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,660
Oh, my God, is she Russian?

110
00:09:31,744 --> 00:09:34,872
- You can't treat us like this.
- I need you to stay calm.

111
00:09:34,955 --> 00:09:36,665
You come into my house,

112
00:09:36,749 --> 00:09:39,252
and you tell me that my
son is hiding some girl,

113
00:09:39,335 --> 00:09:42,463
and that he's in danger,
but you can't tell us why?

114
00:09:42,546 --> 00:09:45,382
And you, what, you
expect me to remain, what, calm?

115
00:09:56,685 --> 00:09:59,063
I understand how upsetting this is.

116
00:10:00,106 --> 00:10:02,358
I wish we could tell you more...

117
00:10:03,692 --> 00:10:08,739
but I can tell you that your
son, Michael, is in real danger.

118
00:10:11,283 --> 00:10:12,660
We want to help him.

119
00:10:12,743 --> 00:10:15,538
We will help him. I give you my word.

120
00:10:17,373 --> 00:10:19,500
But in order for me to do that...

121
00:10:21,127 --> 00:10:22,920
you have to trust me.

122
00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:27,049
Will you trust me?

123
00:10:32,721 --> 00:10:34,014
Good.

124
00:10:34,098 --> 00:10:35,266
Now...

125
00:10:37,184 --> 00:10:39,645
do you have any idea where
your son might have gone?

126
00:10:43,858 --> 00:10:46,986
This is Randolph
Road, right here.

127
00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:50,614
The fence starts here, and
goes all the way around.

128
00:10:51,532 --> 00:10:53,659
And this is the lab right here.

129
00:10:53,742 --> 00:10:55,202
The gate's gotta be in there somewhere.

130
00:10:55,286 --> 00:10:56,329
It's gotta be.

131
00:10:56,412 --> 00:10:58,289
Well, who owns Hawkins Lab?

132
00:10:58,372 --> 00:10:59,852
The sign says "Department of Energy."

133
00:10:59,874 --> 00:11:02,001
Department of Energy? What
do you think that means?

134
00:11:02,084 --> 00:11:04,044
It means government. Military.

135
00:11:04,128 --> 00:11:06,297
- Then why does it say "Energy"?
- Just trust me, all right?

136
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,840
It's military. My dad's told me before.

137
00:11:07,923 --> 00:11:09,675
Mike's right. There's
soldiers out front.

138
00:11:09,758 --> 00:11:11,802
Do they make, like, lightbulbs
or something?

139
00:11:11,886 --> 00:11:13,096
No, weapons...

140
00:11:13,178 --> 00:11:14,680
to fight the
Russians, and commies and stuff.

141
00:11:14,763 --> 00:11:16,306
Weapons.

142
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:19,768
Oh, Jesus, this is bad.

143
00:11:19,852 --> 00:11:22,646
Really bad. The place
is like a fortress.

144
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,772
Well, what do we do?

145
00:11:23,856 --> 00:11:25,524
I don't know,
but we can't go home.

146
00:11:25,608 --> 00:11:27,026
We're fugitives now.

147
00:11:29,486 --> 00:11:30,738
Guys?

148
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,573
Do you hear that?

149
00:11:39,622 --> 00:11:41,040
- Go, go, go, go!
- Come on, come on!

150
00:11:41,123 --> 00:11:42,803
- It's stuck.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

151
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,126
- Hurry up! Hurry, come on!
- Come on!

152
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:45,627
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

153
00:11:47,254 --> 00:11:49,506
Get down!

154
00:11:55,888 --> 00:11:57,264
Mental.

155
00:12:04,355 --> 00:12:06,190
You say blood draws this thing?

156
00:12:06,273 --> 00:12:07,608
We don't know.

157
00:12:08,525 --> 00:12:09,860
It's just a theory.

158
00:12:13,948 --> 00:12:15,158
I'm sorry, Mom.

159
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,243
What, you're sorry?
You're... you're sorry?

160
00:12:18,327 --> 00:12:20,127
- That is not good enough, Jonathan.
- I know.

161
00:12:20,204 --> 00:12:22,623
That's not even close. That's
not even in the... in the ballpark.

162
00:12:22,706 --> 00:12:24,291
I wanted to tell you, I just...

163
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,627
What if this thing took you, too?

164
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:30,005
You risked your life... and Nancy's.

165
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:33,551
I thought I
could save Will... I still do.

166
00:12:33,634 --> 00:12:36,011
This is not yours to fix alone.

167
00:12:36,095 --> 00:12:40,933
You act like you're all
alone out there in the world, but you're not.

168
00:12:41,016 --> 00:12:42,142
You're not alone.

169
00:12:42,226 --> 00:12:43,602
I know.

170
00:12:43,686 --> 00:12:45,104
God damn it, Jonathan.

171
00:12:45,187 --> 00:12:47,898
- I know.
- Damn it.

172
00:12:50,818 --> 00:12:52,059
I want an apology!

173
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:53,237
An apology for what, exactly?

174
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,072
Where is the
chief? I want to speak to him

175
00:12:55,155 --> 00:12:56,490
- right this instant.
- Stay here.

176
00:12:56,573 --> 00:12:58,408
Ma'am, I need you to calm down.

177
00:12:58,492 --> 00:12:59,660
What is your name, Deputy?

178
00:12:59,743 --> 00:13:01,536
Well, I'm an officer...  okay?

179
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,080
Name and
badge number, both of you!

180
00:13:03,163 --> 00:13:05,040
- What the hell is going on here?
- Chief...

181
00:13:05,124 --> 00:13:07,084
These men are humiliating my son.

182
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:09,169
- No, no, no. Okay, that's not true.
- Yes.

183
00:13:09,253 --> 00:13:10,629
There was some kind of fight, Chief...

184
00:13:10,713 --> 00:13:13,382
A psychotic child broke his arm!

185
00:13:13,465 --> 00:13:16,718
- A little girl, Chief. A little one.
- That tone! Do you hear that tone?

186
00:13:16,802 --> 00:13:18,053
Honestly, I'm just
trying to state a fact.

187
00:13:18,137 --> 00:13:19,555
- I don't have time for this.
- It was a little girl...

188
00:13:19,638 --> 00:13:22,224
Will you please take a
statement...  and get her out?

189
00:13:22,307 --> 00:13:23,475
- Yes.
- So what'd this girl look like?

190
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:26,729
She had no hair and she
was bleeding from her nose.

191
00:13:26,812 --> 00:13:28,731
Like a freak.

192
00:13:28,814 --> 00:13:29,940
What'd you just say?

193
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:32,151
I said she's a freak!

194
00:13:32,234 --> 00:13:35,029
No, her hair. What'd
you say about her hair?

195
00:13:35,112 --> 00:13:37,031
Her head's shaved.

196
00:13:37,114 --> 00:13:38,866
She doesn't even look like a girl.

197
00:13:40,284 --> 00:13:41,285
And...

198
00:13:42,036 --> 00:13:43,120
And what?

199
00:13:44,455 --> 00:13:46,206
Tell the man, Troy.

200
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,877
She can...

201
00:13:52,254 --> 00:13:53,422
do things.

202
00:13:53,505 --> 00:13:55,799
What kind of things?

203
00:13:55,883 --> 00:13:56,925
Like...

204
00:13:59,303 --> 00:14:00,345
make you fly.

205
00:14:03,307 --> 00:14:04,641
And piss yourself.

206
00:14:04,725 --> 00:14:05,726
What?

207
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:08,312
Was she alone?

208
00:14:09,772 --> 00:14:11,607
She always hangs out with those losers.

209
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,858
"Losers"?

210
00:14:13,901 --> 00:14:15,486
What losers?

211
00:14:19,448 --> 00:14:20,657
Hey.

212
00:14:21,784 --> 00:14:23,286
You owe me $1.20.

213
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:27,414
Don't worry, he'll need more than
aspirin when we're done with him.

214
00:14:27,498 --> 00:14:30,167
Yeah, if the creep ever gets out.

215
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,891
The cops should just
lock him up forever.

216
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:34,505
Did you see the look on his face?

217
00:14:34,588 --> 00:14:36,423
Oh.

218
00:14:36,507 --> 00:14:38,842
He probably had that same look whenever
he killed his brother, right?

219
00:14:38,926 --> 00:14:43,430
Oh, God, I just got an
image of him making that face

220
00:14:43,514 --> 00:14:44,848
while he and Nancy are screwing.

221
00:14:44,932 --> 00:14:46,767
Carol, for once in your
life, shut your damn mouth!

222
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,561
- What?
- Hey, what's your problem, man?

223
00:14:51,313 --> 00:14:52,981
You're both assholes. That's my problem.

224
00:14:53,065 --> 00:14:54,400
- Are you serious right now, man?
- Yeah, I'm serious.

225
00:14:54,483 --> 00:14:55,484
You shouldn't have done that.

226
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:56,860
- Done what?
- You know what.

227
00:14:56,944 --> 00:14:58,821
You mean call her out
for what she really is?

228
00:14:58,904 --> 00:15:01,156
Oh, that's funny, because I
don't remember you asking me to stop.

229
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,908
I should've put that spray
paint right down your throat.

230
00:15:02,991 --> 00:15:04,672
- What the hell, Steve?
- You know,

231
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:06,786
neither of you ever cared about
her. You never even liked her,

232
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,538
because she's not
miserable like you two.

233
00:15:08,622 --> 00:15:10,040
She actually cares about other people.

234
00:15:10,124 --> 00:15:11,375
The slut with a heart of gold.

235
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:12,699
I told you to watch your mouth!

236
00:15:12,751 --> 00:15:15,045
Hey! I don't know what's
gotten into you, man,

237
00:15:15,129 --> 00:15:17,450
- but you don't talk to her that way.
- Get out of my face.

238
00:15:17,506 --> 00:15:19,008
Or what?

239
00:15:19,091 --> 00:15:20,175
Or what?

240
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:21,844
You gonna fight me now, too? Huh?

241
00:15:21,927 --> 00:15:23,047
You gonna fight me now, too?

242
00:15:23,095 --> 00:15:25,389
Because you couldn't
take Jonathan Byers...

243
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:29,226
so I wouldn't recommend that.

244
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,402
Here, let me get
the door for you, buddy.

245
00:15:38,485 --> 00:15:41,279
That's right. Run away, Stevie boy!

246
00:15:41,363 --> 00:15:43,866
Run away! Just like you always do.

247
00:15:43,949 --> 00:15:47,286
That Nancy's turning
you into a little pussy!

248
00:15:48,203 --> 00:15:50,664
That's right, Harrington, run away!

249
00:15:50,747 --> 00:15:53,375
Run away!

250
00:16:03,135 --> 00:16:04,553
I have to go home.

251
00:16:04,636 --> 00:16:06,138
No, you can't.

252
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:09,975
- My mom... my dad are there.
- They're gonna be okay.

253
00:16:11,643 --> 00:16:13,520
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Let go.

254
00:16:13,604 --> 00:16:15,245
- Let go!
- Hey! Listen to me. Listen to me.

255
00:16:15,314 --> 00:16:16,774
The last thing in the world we need

256
00:16:16,857 --> 00:16:18,577
is them knowing you're
mixed up in all this.

257
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,194
- Mike is over there...
- They haven't found him.

258
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:22,571
Not yet, at least.

259
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,909
- For Mike?
- Come on, get in the car.

260
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:32,372
Look, we need to find
them before they do.

261
00:16:32,456 --> 00:16:33,790
Do you have any idea where
he might have gone?

262
00:16:33,874 --> 00:16:36,668
- No, I don't.
- I need you to think.

263
00:16:36,752 --> 00:16:38,462
I don't know. We haven't talked a lot.

264
00:16:38,545 --> 00:16:40,380
I mean, lately...

265
00:16:40,464 --> 00:16:41,705
Is there any place that your...

266
00:16:41,715 --> 00:16:43,675
your parents don't
know about that he might go?

267
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,886
- I don't know.
- I might.

268
00:16:45,969 --> 00:16:47,054
What?

269
00:16:47,137 --> 00:16:51,141
I don't know where he is, but
I think I know how to ask him.

270
00:17:00,442 --> 00:17:01,610
Whoa.

271
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:10,702
I got it.

272
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:22,255
Mike, are you there? Mike?

273
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:23,674
You guys hear that?

274
00:17:23,757 --> 00:17:25,884
Mike, it's me, Nancy.

275
00:17:28,178 --> 00:17:29,638
Mike, are you there?

276
00:17:29,721 --> 00:17:31,390
Answer.

277
00:17:31,473 --> 00:17:33,141
Mike, we need you to answer.

278
00:17:33,225 --> 00:17:34,768
Is that your sister?

279
00:17:35,727 --> 00:17:38,397
This is an emergency, Mike.

280
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,773
Do you copy?

281
00:17:41,024 --> 00:17:42,442
Mike, do you copy?

282
00:17:42,526 --> 00:17:44,069
Okay, this is really weird.

283
00:17:44,152 --> 00:17:45,654
Don't answer.

284
00:17:45,737 --> 00:17:47,897
- She said it was an emergency.
- What if it's a trick?

285
00:17:47,906 --> 00:17:50,659
- It's your sister!
- What if the bad people kidnapped her?

286
00:17:50,742 --> 00:17:52,503
What if they're forcing her to say this?

287
00:17:52,528 --> 00:17:53,644
I need you to answer.

288
00:17:53,704 --> 00:17:56,248
It's like Lando
Calrissian. Don't answer.

289
00:17:56,331 --> 00:17:58,083
We need to know that you're there, Mike.

290
00:17:58,792 --> 00:18:01,628
Listen, kid, this is the
chief. If you're there, pick up.

291
00:18:01,712 --> 00:18:03,792
We know you're in trouble
and we know about the girl.

292
00:18:03,797 --> 00:18:05,841
Why is she with the chief?

293
00:18:05,924 --> 00:18:07,285
How the hell does he know about...

294
00:18:07,301 --> 00:18:11,221
We can protect you, we
can help you, but you gotta pick up.

295
00:18:11,305 --> 00:18:13,932
Are you there? Do you copy? Over.

296
00:18:21,064 --> 00:18:22,858
Anybody got any other ideas?

297
00:18:24,443 --> 00:18:25,944
Yeah, I copy.

298
00:18:27,946 --> 00:18:28,989
It's Mike.

299
00:18:29,072 --> 00:18:30,407
I'm here.

300
00:18:32,784 --> 00:18:34,036
We're here.

301
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,172
Need a hand?

302
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:48,425
Did you have something to do with this?

303
00:18:49,426 --> 00:18:50,594
I just...

304
00:18:51,595 --> 00:18:52,763
I wanna help.

305
00:19:01,104 --> 00:19:02,481
All yours.

306
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:19,081
They expect us to
just sit here like prisoners.

307
00:19:19,164 --> 00:19:20,791
We should be out there looking for him.

308
00:19:20,874 --> 00:19:23,669
Honey, we have to trust them, okay?

309
00:19:23,752 --> 00:19:26,546
This is our
government. They're on our side.

310
00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:30,551
That man gives me the creeps.

311
00:19:33,095 --> 00:19:34,263
Nancy.

312
00:19:34,346 --> 00:19:36,807
You don't think she's involved
in this, too, do you?

313
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,308
Nancy with Mike?

314
00:19:38,392 --> 00:19:39,851
No.

315
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:42,938
No.

316
00:19:54,449 --> 00:19:55,784
Will you stop pacing?

317
00:19:55,867 --> 00:19:57,828
It's been way too long.

318
00:19:57,911 --> 00:20:00,831
Do you know what? Maybe you're
right. Maybe this is all a trap

319
00:20:00,914 --> 00:20:02,624
and the bad men are
coming to get us right now!

320
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:03,709
It's not a trap.

321
00:20:03,792 --> 00:20:05,794
Why would the chief set us up?

322
00:20:05,877 --> 00:20:08,046
Nancy, maybe, but the chief?

323
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,506
Lando Calrissian.

324
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:11,257
Would you shut up about Lando?

325
00:20:11,341 --> 00:20:13,260
I don't feel good about
this. I don't feel good about this!

326
00:20:13,343 --> 00:20:15,223
When do you
feel good about anything?

327
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,233
Shit!

328
00:20:28,316 --> 00:20:29,651
Go, go, go, go.

329
00:20:31,903 --> 00:20:33,613
Lando.

330
00:20:33,697 --> 00:20:35,449
You think they saw us?

331
00:20:35,532 --> 00:20:37,200
Both of you, shut up.

332
00:21:22,329 --> 00:21:23,489
Hey!

333
00:21:24,915 --> 00:21:26,250
What the...

334
00:21:31,922 --> 00:21:33,924
All right, let's go.

335
00:21:35,634 --> 00:21:37,260
Let's go!

336
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,786
Mike. Oh, my God. Mike!

337
00:22:06,623 --> 00:22:08,667
I was so worried about you.

338
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,169
Yeah, uh... me, too.

339
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,884
Is that my dress?

340
00:22:21,263 --> 00:22:24,558
Okay, so, in this
example, we're the acrobat.

341
00:22:24,641 --> 00:22:27,561
Will and Barbara, and that
monster, they're this flea.

342
00:22:27,644 --> 00:22:30,021
And this is the Upside
Down, where Will is hiding.

343
00:22:30,105 --> 00:22:33,567
Mr. Clarke said the only way to get
there is through a rip of time and space.

344
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,251
- A gate.
- That we tracked to Hawkins Lab.

345
00:22:35,318 --> 00:22:36,611
With our compasses.

346
00:22:38,572 --> 00:22:41,825
Okay, so the gate has a really
strong electromagnetic field,

347
00:22:41,908 --> 00:22:44,119
and that can change the
directions of a compass needle.

348
00:22:44,202 --> 00:22:45,412
Is this gate underground?

349
00:22:45,495 --> 00:22:47,163
Yes.

350
00:22:48,498 --> 00:22:50,250
Near a large water tank?

351
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:52,127
Yes.

352
00:22:53,003 --> 00:22:54,462
How do you know all that?

353
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:57,632
He's seen it.

354
00:22:57,716 --> 00:22:59,551
Is there any
way that you could...

355
00:23:00,844 --> 00:23:03,365
that you could reach Will? That
you could talk to him in this...

356
00:23:03,388 --> 00:23:04,472
The Upside Down.

357
00:23:04,556 --> 00:23:06,182
Down. Yeah.

358
00:23:07,851 --> 00:23:09,051
And my friend Barbara?

359
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,520
Can you find her, too?

360
00:23:46,806 --> 00:23:47,849
I'm sorry.

361
00:23:47,932 --> 00:23:48,975
What?

362
00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:51,186
What's
wrong? What happened?

363
00:23:51,311 --> 00:23:53,938
I can't find them.

364
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,724
Whenever she uses
her powers, she gets weak.

365
00:24:29,808 --> 00:24:32,352
The more energy she
uses, the more tired she gets.

366
00:24:32,435 --> 00:24:35,021
- Like, she flipped the van earlier.
- It was awesome.

367
00:24:35,105 --> 00:24:37,399
- But she's drained.
- Like a bad battery.

368
00:24:37,482 --> 00:24:40,360
Well...  How
do we make her better?

369
00:24:40,443 --> 00:24:43,279
We don't. We just have
to wait and try again.

370
00:24:43,363 --> 00:24:45,198
Well, how long?

371
00:24:45,281 --> 00:24:46,657
I don't know.

372
00:24:46,741 --> 00:24:47,992
The bath.

373
00:24:48,076 --> 00:24:49,327
What?

374
00:24:51,955 --> 00:24:53,623
I can find them.

375
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:56,167
In the bath.

376
00:25:01,381 --> 00:25:02,549
Oh!

377
00:25:04,718 --> 00:25:06,970
Oh. Oh, my... No, mmm-mmm.

378
00:25:07,053 --> 00:25:09,055
Hey, you know how they did
that? You know what that is?

379
00:25:09,139 --> 00:25:10,390
No, what?

380
00:25:10,473 --> 00:25:13,017
Melted plastic and
microwaved bubble gum.

381
00:25:13,101 --> 00:25:14,978
No way. Really?

382
00:25:15,061 --> 00:25:16,604
Really.

383
00:25:19,107 --> 00:25:21,067
- What in the world?
- Do you want me to pause it?

384
00:25:21,151 --> 00:25:22,736
I'm sure it's just a wrong number.

385
00:25:25,697 --> 00:25:26,740
Hello?

386
00:25:26,823 --> 00:25:28,616
Mr. Clarke? It's Dustin.

387
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,578
Dustin? Is everything okay?

388
00:25:31,661 --> 00:25:33,288
Yeah, yeah. I just, I...

389
00:25:33,371 --> 00:25:35,457
I have a science question.

390
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,918
It's ten o'clock on
Saturday. Why don't we pick this up...

391
00:25:39,002 --> 00:25:41,963
Do you know anything about
sensory deprivation tanks?

392
00:25:42,046 --> 00:25:43,840
Specifically how to build one?

393
00:25:43,923 --> 00:25:46,885
Sensory deprivation?
What is this for?

394
00:25:47,594 --> 00:25:49,179
Fun.

395
00:25:49,262 --> 00:25:50,930
Okay. Well...

396
00:25:51,848 --> 00:25:54,184
Why don't we talk about it
Monday? After school, okay?

397
00:25:54,267 --> 00:25:56,728
You always say we should
never stop being curious.

398
00:25:56,811 --> 00:25:58,730
To always open any
curiosity door we find.

399
00:25:58,813 --> 00:25:59,856
Dustin...

400
00:25:59,939 --> 00:26:02,567
Why are you keeping this
curiosity door locked?

401
00:26:05,195 --> 00:26:06,404
Uh-huh.

402
00:26:10,033 --> 00:26:11,451
Uh-huh. How much?

403
00:26:12,368 --> 00:26:13,411
Uh-huh.

404
00:26:14,704 --> 00:26:17,498
Yep, all right. Yeah, we'll be careful.

405
00:26:17,582 --> 00:26:19,209
Definitely. All right, Mr. Clarke.

406
00:26:19,292 --> 00:26:21,503
Yeah, I'll see you on Monday. I'll
see you on Monday, Mr. Clarke.

407
00:26:21,586 --> 00:26:22,962
Bye.

408
00:26:23,046 --> 00:26:25,367
Do you still have that kiddie
pool we bobbed for apples in?

409
00:26:25,423 --> 00:26:27,717
- I think so. Yeah.
- Yeah.

410
00:26:27,801 --> 00:26:29,469
Good. Then we just
need salt. Lots of it.

411
00:26:29,552 --> 00:26:31,262
How much is "lots"?

412
00:26:33,348 --> 00:26:34,432
1,500 pounds.

413
00:26:35,141 --> 00:26:37,227
Well, where are we
gonna get that much salt?

414
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,326
Hey, wait.

415
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:55,370
It's not gonna snow next week, is it?

416
00:26:55,453 --> 00:26:57,538
Worst case, no school.

417
00:26:57,622 --> 00:27:00,333
Even if we find Will in there...

418
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:01,959
what are we gonna do about that thing?

419
00:27:02,043 --> 00:27:03,336
We're not gonna do anything.

420
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:04,837
I don't want you anywhere
near this, all right?

421
00:27:04,921 --> 00:27:06,507
Your mom's been through enough already.

422
00:27:06,532 --> 00:27:07,364
He's my brother.

423
00:27:07,423 --> 00:27:10,760
Listen to me. I'm gonna
find him. All right?

424
00:27:10,844 --> 00:27:12,387
You gotta trust me on this.

425
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,180
I am going to find him.

426
00:27:20,728 --> 00:27:22,689
This damn thing is heavy.

427
00:27:28,903 --> 00:27:30,655
Come on. It's upside down.

428
00:27:30,738 --> 00:27:31,989
No, this way.

429
00:27:34,868 --> 00:27:36,035
- Okay, um...
- How does this even work?

430
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:38,621
- Try that side.
- Son of a bitch!

431
00:27:38,705 --> 00:27:40,707
- Pull it back. Pull it back.
- I am!

432
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:43,418
One, two, three.

433
00:27:43,501 --> 00:27:44,836
Shit!

434
00:27:53,177 --> 00:27:54,470
Ah.

435
00:27:54,554 --> 00:27:55,638
Stand back.

436
00:28:02,478 --> 00:28:04,105
Whoa.

437
00:28:13,907 --> 00:28:15,825
What did she even eat?

438
00:28:15,909 --> 00:28:18,536
- What?
- Eleven.

439
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:22,874
Oh. Candy, leftovers, Eggos...

440
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:26,210
She really likes Eggos.

441
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,505
I knew you were
acting weird. I just...

442
00:28:29,589 --> 00:28:31,633
I thought it was because of Will.

443
00:28:31,716 --> 00:28:34,594
I knew you were acting weird,
too. I thought it was 'cause of Steve.

444
00:28:36,012 --> 00:28:37,096
Hey...

445
00:28:39,224 --> 00:28:41,017
No more secrets, okay?

446
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,144
From now on we tell
each other everything.

447
00:28:43,228 --> 00:28:46,272
Okay. Do you like Jonathan now?

448
00:28:46,356 --> 00:28:48,316
What? No.

449
00:28:49,275 --> 00:28:52,070
No, it's... it's
not... it's not like that.

450
00:28:53,655 --> 00:28:54,906
Do you like Eleven?

451
00:28:54,989 --> 00:28:58,326
What? No. Ew. Gross.

452
00:29:11,214 --> 00:29:14,509
This will keep it dark for you.

453
00:29:14,592 --> 00:29:16,678
Just like in your bathtub.

454
00:29:19,806 --> 00:29:21,516
You're a very brave girl.

455
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:23,393
You know that, don't you?

456
00:29:24,435 --> 00:29:28,398
Everything you're
doing for my boy... for Will...

457
00:29:29,899 --> 00:29:31,484
for my family...

458
00:29:33,611 --> 00:29:35,738
Thank you.

459
00:29:39,325 --> 00:29:40,576
Listen.

460
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,956
I am gonna be there with
you the whole time.

461
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,000
And if it ever gets too scary...

462
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:51,462
in that place,
you just let me know, okay?

463
00:29:54,507 --> 00:29:55,550
Yes.

464
00:29:58,219 --> 00:29:59,262
Ready?

465
00:30:04,183 --> 00:30:05,226
Ready.

466
00:30:22,618 --> 00:30:24,203
Colder!

467
00:30:26,164 --> 00:30:27,457
Warmer!

468
00:30:29,792 --> 00:30:31,252
Right there!

469
00:32:49,098 --> 00:32:50,141
Barb?

470
00:32:50,224 --> 00:32:51,476
Barbara?

471
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,884
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

472
00:33:25,843 --> 00:33:28,888
Is Barb okay? Is she okay?

473
00:33:28,971 --> 00:33:30,973
Gone! Gone!

474
00:33:31,057 --> 00:33:32,808
Gone!

475
00:33:32,892 --> 00:33:35,561
Gone! Gone!

476
00:33:35,645 --> 00:33:37,939
Gone. Gone.

477
00:33:38,022 --> 00:33:39,524
Gone.

478
00:33:39,607 --> 00:33:41,400
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

479
00:33:41,484 --> 00:33:43,778
- Gone. Gone!
- It's okay. It's okay.

480
00:33:43,861 --> 00:33:45,279
Gone!

481
00:33:45,363 --> 00:33:47,115
Hey. It's okay.

482
00:33:47,198 --> 00:33:49,701
It's okay, we're right
here. We're right here, honey.

483
00:33:49,784 --> 00:33:53,037
It's okay. I got you.

484
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,957
Don't be afraid.

485
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,542
I'm right here with you.

486
00:33:57,625 --> 00:34:00,169
I'm right here with you.

487
00:34:00,253 --> 00:34:02,421
It's okay. It's okay.

488
00:34:02,505 --> 00:34:04,799
It's okay.

489
00:34:04,882 --> 00:34:07,009
It's okay, you're safe.

490
00:34:07,093 --> 00:34:08,469
You're okay, honey.

491
00:34:09,345 --> 00:34:10,972
Castle Byers.

492
00:34:11,556 --> 00:34:12,932
Castle Byers.

493
00:34:52,346 --> 00:34:53,389
Will.

494
00:34:53,472 --> 00:34:55,307
Will?

495
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,732
You tell him... tell him I'm coming.

496
00:35:02,815 --> 00:35:04,317
Mom is coming.

497
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,527
Your mom...
she's coming for you.

498
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,531
Hurry.

499
00:35:11,115 --> 00:35:12,158
Hurry.

500
00:35:14,493 --> 00:35:17,622
Okay. Listen, you tell him
to...  to stay where he is.

501
00:35:17,705 --> 00:35:20,708
We're coming. We're coming,
okay? We're coming, honey.

502
00:35:20,791 --> 00:35:23,044
Just... just hold on a little longer.

503
00:35:23,127 --> 00:35:25,212
Will. Will.

504
00:35:36,432 --> 00:35:37,558
Will?

505
00:35:38,476 --> 00:35:39,560
Will!

506
00:35:46,567 --> 00:35:48,277
Oh!

507
00:35:48,361 --> 00:35:51,072
Oh, okay, okay.

508
00:35:52,281 --> 00:35:53,324
I've got you.

509
00:35:54,784 --> 00:35:56,619
It's okay. I got you. I got you.

510
00:35:57,244 --> 00:35:59,872
I got you, honey. You did so good.

511
00:36:02,249 --> 00:36:04,334
Are you okay?

512
00:36:05,628 --> 00:36:07,880
So
this fort. Where is it?

513
00:36:07,963 --> 00:36:09,757
Uh, it's in
the woods behind our house.

514
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,259
Yeah, he used to go there to hide.

515
00:36:18,015 --> 00:36:19,266
Hey, get back inside.

516
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,476
What, are you insane?

517
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:21,852
- No, I'm...
- Look, if something happens to me,

518
00:36:21,936 --> 00:36:22,978
I don't make it back...

519
00:36:23,062 --> 00:36:24,772
Yeah, but then I'll go. You stay.

520
00:36:24,855 --> 00:36:25,981
Are you kidding me?

521
00:36:26,065 --> 00:36:29,318
He's my son, Hop. My son.

522
00:36:29,402 --> 00:36:30,486
I'm going!

523
00:36:31,612 --> 00:36:32,771
Now, listen, I need you to stay here...

524
00:36:32,796 --> 00:36:33,356
No.

525
00:36:33,406 --> 00:36:34,741
- and watch over the kids.
- No, Mom.

526
00:36:34,824 --> 00:36:36,659
- I can help.
- Please, I need you to stay, Jonathan.

527
00:36:36,742 --> 00:36:37,743
Joyce!

528
00:36:37,827 --> 00:36:39,027
- Please.
- Please, be careful.

529
00:36:39,078 --> 00:36:40,621
- Joyce, come on!
- Please. I'm gonna find him.

530
00:36:40,705 --> 00:36:42,457
I'm gonna find him.

531
00:37:16,782 --> 00:37:18,826
We have to go back to the station.

532
00:37:20,286 --> 00:37:21,328
What?

533
00:37:22,246 --> 00:37:27,835
Your mom and Hopper are just
walking in there like bait.

534
00:37:28,919 --> 00:37:31,839
That thing is still in there.

535
00:37:33,883 --> 00:37:37,261
And we can't just sit
here and let it get them, too.

536
00:37:37,344 --> 00:37:38,637
We can't.

537
00:37:42,767 --> 00:37:44,977
You still wanna try it out?

538
00:37:45,728 --> 00:37:48,063
I wanna finish what we started.

539
00:37:49,774 --> 00:37:51,650
I want to kill it.

540
00:38:06,165 --> 00:38:07,708
So this is your plan?

541
00:38:07,792 --> 00:38:09,502
Worked for me before, didn't it?

542
00:38:09,585 --> 00:38:11,796
- Well, did it?
- Come on, trust me.

543
00:38:13,047 --> 00:38:15,007
I'd like
to hear your thoughts on the war.

544
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:17,092
I think we're dealing with a
whole different environment here.

545
00:38:17,176 --> 00:38:18,844
I'll tell
you what, we always planned

546
00:38:18,928 --> 00:38:21,222
on the Russians massing
the fire and we...

547
00:38:38,864 --> 00:38:40,224
Don't move!

548
00:38:40,991 --> 00:38:42,701
All right, move in.

549
00:38:42,785 --> 00:38:44,245
It's all right.

550
00:38:44,328 --> 00:38:45,704
Let me do the talking.

551
00:38:52,419 --> 00:38:54,588
♪ If I go there will be trouble ♪

552
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,634
♪ And if I stay it will be double ♪

553
00:38:59,718 --> 00:39:02,429
♪ So, come on and let me know ♪

554
00:39:03,472 --> 00:39:05,557
♪ Should I stay or
should I go now? ♪

555
00:39:37,364 --> 00:39:41,653
