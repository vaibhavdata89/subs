1
00:00:14,665 --> 00:00:16,667
Is there a number we can call
for your parents?

2
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,836
Where's your hair?
Do you have cancer?

3
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:20,129
Did you run away?

4
00:00:20,212 --> 00:00:22,131
- Are you in some kind of trouble?
- Is that blood?

5
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:25,008
- Stop it! You're freaking her out!
- She's freaking me out!

6
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:26,301
I bet she's deaf.

7
00:00:28,387 --> 00:00:29,471
Not deaf.

8
00:00:29,555 --> 00:00:32,850
All right, that's enough, all right?
She's just scared and cold.

9
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:41,316
Here, these are clean.
Okay?

10
00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:53,287
No, no, no!

11
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,997
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

12
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,333
- See over there?
- That's the bathroom.

13
00:00:58,417 --> 00:01:00,419
Privacy.
Get it?

14
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:16,810
You don't want it closed?

15
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:19,646
No.

16
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,815
Oh, so you can speak.

17
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:24,109
Okay, well...

18
00:01:24,193 --> 00:01:28,197
Um, how about we just keep the door...

19
00:01:30,449 --> 00:01:32,034
just like this.

20
00:01:32,534 --> 00:01:35,245
- Is that better?
- Yes.

21
00:01:40,876 --> 00:01:43,003
- This is mental.
- At least she can talk.

22
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:45,964
She said "no" and "yes."
Your three-year-old sister says more.

23
00:01:46,048 --> 00:01:47,758
She tried to get naked.

24
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,468
There's something
seriously wrong with her.

25
00:01:49,551 --> 00:01:53,055
- Like, wrong in the head.
- She just went like...

26
00:01:53,138 --> 00:01:54,598
I bet she escaped from Pennhurst.

27
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:57,309
- From where?
- The nuthouse in Kerley County.

28
00:01:57,392 --> 00:01:59,019
- You got a lot of family there?
- Bite me.

29
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:01,104
Seriously though, think about it.

30
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:04,233
That would explain her shaved hair
and why she's so crazy.

31
00:02:04,316 --> 00:02:05,442
Why she went like...

32
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:08,320
She's an escapee is the point.
She's probably a psycho.

33
00:02:08,403 --> 00:02:10,405
- Like Michael Myers.
- Exactly!

34
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:12,074
We should've never brought her here.

35
00:02:12,157 --> 00:02:13,492
So you just wanted to leave her
out in that storm?

36
00:02:13,575 --> 00:02:16,328
Yes! We went out to find Will,
not another problem.

37
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:18,121
- I think we should tell your mom.
- I second that.

38
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:20,165
- Who's crazy now?
- How is that crazy?

39
00:02:20,249 --> 00:02:22,834
'Cause, we weren't supposed to be
out tonight, remember?

40
00:02:22,918 --> 00:02:25,254
- So?
- So if I tell my mom

41
00:02:25,337 --> 00:02:27,172
and she tells your mom
and your mom...

42
00:02:27,256 --> 00:02:29,508
- Oh, man.
- Our houses become Alcatraz.

43
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:32,177
Exactly.
We'll never find Will.

44
00:02:33,929 --> 00:02:36,473
All right, here's the plan.
She sleeps here tonight.

45
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:38,684
- You're letting a girl...
- Just listen!

46
00:02:38,767 --> 00:02:40,727
In the morning,
she sneaks around my house,

47
00:02:40,811 --> 00:02:42,854
goes to the front door
and rings my doorbell.

48
00:02:42,938 --> 00:02:44,731
My mom will answer and know
exactly what to do.

49
00:02:44,815 --> 00:02:47,067
She'll send her back to Pennhurst
or wherever she comes from.

50
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,277
We'll be totally in the clear.

51
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,153
And tomorrow night, we go back out.

52
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:52,614
And this time, we find Will.

53
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:59,246
Here you go.
This is my sleeping bag.

54
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:01,623
You really think she's psycho?

55
00:03:01,707 --> 00:03:03,292
Wouldn't want her in my house.

56
00:03:07,713 --> 00:03:09,339
Mental.

57
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:13,677
Hey, um, I never asked your name.

58
00:03:21,143 --> 00:03:22,394
Is that real?

59
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:29,484
Sorry, I've just... never seen
a kid with a tattoo before.

60
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,112
What's it mean?
Eleven?

61
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:36,575
That's your name?

62
00:03:38,702 --> 00:03:40,746
Eleven. Okay.

63
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:44,166
Um, well, my name's Mike.
Short for Michael.

64
00:03:44,249 --> 00:03:47,461
Maybe we can call you "El."
Short for Eleven.

65
00:03:51,506 --> 00:03:52,924
Um, well, okay.

66
00:03:53,842 --> 00:03:55,093
'Night, El.

67
00:03:57,346 --> 00:03:58,639
'Night, Mike.

68
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:19,228


69
00:05:53,044 --> 00:05:56,715
All right, Mom.
Breakfast is ready.

70
00:05:56,798 --> 00:05:59,593
- What? No, be careful of the poster.
- Yeah, okay. All right.

71
00:05:59,676 --> 00:06:01,553
- I can't eat.
- I just need you to eat, Mom.

72
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:05,056
Listen. Listen, the Xerox place
opens in, like, 30 minutes.

73
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,558
- Yeah.
- And I don't want you to go alone...

74
00:06:06,641 --> 00:06:07,726
No, I know.
I told you, I got it.

75
00:06:07,809 --> 00:06:10,228
...so I'm gonna have Karen take you,
'cause I should be here.

76
00:06:10,312 --> 00:06:12,689
- Okay.
- We need to make, what, 200, 300 copies?

77
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:13,899
- How much is a copy?
- Yeah, okay.

78
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:15,066
- Okay, Mom. Mom.
- Ten cents?

79
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,777
- If we... Ten cents...
- Mom. Mom. Mom!

80
00:06:17,861 --> 00:06:20,113
You can't get like this, okay?

81
00:06:20,197 --> 00:06:22,616
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

82
00:06:25,202 --> 00:06:28,497
We've been waiting six hours.

83
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,290
I know.
I came as soon as I could.

84
00:06:30,373 --> 00:06:31,958
Six hours.

85
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:34,169
A little bit of trust here, all right?

86
00:06:34,252 --> 00:06:37,214
We've been searching all night.
Went all the way to Cartersville.

87
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:38,965
- And?
- Nothing.

88
00:06:39,049 --> 00:06:40,467
God.

89
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,554
Flo says you got a phone call?

90
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:46,806
Oh, yeah.

91
00:06:54,105 --> 00:06:55,732
Storm barbecued this pretty good.

92
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,235
- The storm?
- What else?

93
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:01,238
You're saying that that's not weird?

94
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:02,989
No, it's weird.

95
00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:05,575
Can we, like, trace who made the call?
Contact the...

96
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,661
No, it doesn't work like that.

97
00:07:07,744 --> 00:07:09,496
Now, uh, you're sure it was Will?

98
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:11,248
Because Flo said
you just heard some breathing.

99
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:14,376
No. It was him.
It was Will.

100
00:07:15,377 --> 00:07:19,422
And he was scared.
And then something...

101
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:22,342
It was probably just a prank call.
It was somebody trying to scare you.

102
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:24,177
- Who would do that?
- Well, this thing's been on TV.

103
00:07:24,261 --> 00:07:27,430
It brings out all the crazies, you know.
False leads, prank calls, uh...

104
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:30,517
No, Hopper, it was not a prank.
It was him.

105
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,228
- Joyce.
- Come on, how about a little trust here?

106
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:36,523
What, you think I'm... I'm making this up?

107
00:07:36,606 --> 00:07:38,066
I'm not saying that you're making it up.

108
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:40,610
All I'm saying is
it's an emotional time for you.

109
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:43,989
And you think I don't know
my own son's breathing?

110
00:07:44,072 --> 00:07:45,699
Wouldn't you know your own daughter's?

111
00:07:59,588 --> 00:08:02,757
- You hear from, uh, Lonnie yet?
- No.

112
00:08:03,341 --> 00:08:05,218
It's been long enough.
I'm having him checked out.

113
00:08:05,302 --> 00:08:06,970
Oh, come on!

114
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,139
You're wasting your time.

115
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:12,851
Hey, Hopper.

116
00:08:12,934 --> 00:08:15,103
Hopper.

117
00:08:15,186 --> 00:08:16,438
Let me go.

118
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,858
- I'm sorry?
- To Lonnie's.

119
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:22,819
You know, if Will's there,
it means he ran away.

120
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:25,322
And if he sees the cops,
he'll think he's in trouble.

121
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:27,115
He'll... He'll hide.

122
00:08:27,198 --> 00:08:28,909
- You know, he's good at hiding.
- Yeah?

123
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,329
Well, cops are good at finding.
Okay?

124
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:34,080
Stay here with your mom.

125
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:36,374
She needs you.

126
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,729
Slow down, Mike.
That's disgusting.

127
00:08:59,189 --> 00:09:01,066
Do a lot of studying last night?

128
00:09:01,816 --> 00:09:03,735
Yeah, actually, I did.

129
00:09:03,818 --> 00:09:06,196
What was your test on again?
Human anatomy?

130
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:09,991
Hey, what's going on?

131
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,494
Nothing.

132
00:09:23,922 --> 00:09:25,298
Hey, you found my supercomm.

133
00:09:25,382 --> 00:09:26,549
Pretty cool, huh?

134
00:09:27,217 --> 00:09:28,510
I talk to my friends with it.

135
00:09:28,593 --> 00:09:30,470
Mostly Lucas,
'cause he lives so close.

136
00:09:30,553 --> 00:09:31,638
Signal's pretty weak.

137
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,018
Got you breakfast.

138
00:09:39,604 --> 00:09:41,564
So listen, this is gonna
sound a little weird,

139
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:42,983
but I just need you to go out there.

140
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:45,193
Then go to the front door
and ring the doorbell.

141
00:09:45,276 --> 00:09:48,822
My mom will answer and you'll tell her
that you're lost and that you need help.

142
00:09:48,905 --> 00:09:53,034
But whatever you do, you can't tell her
about last night or that you know me.

143
00:09:53,118 --> 00:09:54,119
Understand?

144
00:09:55,245 --> 00:09:56,621
Really, it's no big deal.

145
00:09:56,705 --> 00:09:58,832
We'll just pretend
to meet each other again.

146
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,502
And my mom, she'll know who to call.

147
00:10:04,963 --> 00:10:06,006
No.

148
00:10:07,298 --> 00:10:08,425
No?

149
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:10,260
No.

150
00:10:11,261 --> 00:10:14,681
No... you don't want my mom to get help?

151
00:10:19,477 --> 00:10:22,022
You're in trouble, aren't you?

152
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:26,901
Who...

153
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,030
Who are you in trouble with?

154
00:10:32,782 --> 00:10:34,325
Bad.

155
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:35,493
Bad?

156
00:10:36,494 --> 00:10:37,662
Bad people?

157
00:10:41,332 --> 00:10:43,376
They want to hurt you?

158
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,878
The bad people?

159
00:10:54,637 --> 00:10:56,306
Understand?

160
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,893
Michael, where are you?
We're going to be late.

161
00:10:59,976 --> 00:11:01,686
- Let's go!
- All right, I'll be back.

162
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,521
Just stay here, okay?
Stay here.

163
00:11:10,862 --> 00:11:12,280
When was this?

164
00:11:12,363 --> 00:11:13,990
Last night.
Less than two miles away.

165
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,867
- And the boy?
- Still missing.

166
00:11:16,618 --> 00:11:19,662
<i>It was my son.</i>
<i>I know it.</i>

167
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:22,040
<i>And I... I heard something else.</i>

168
00:11:22,123 --> 00:11:23,500
<i>Something else?</i>

169
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:28,213
<i>It was like, uh,</i>
<i>some kind of animal.</i>

170
00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:31,800
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Just please tell Hop to hurry.</i>

171
00:11:31,883 --> 00:11:34,803
Will! Will Byers!

172
00:11:35,678 --> 00:11:37,555
Will Byers!

173
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,393
- Will!
- Will!

174
00:11:42,477 --> 00:11:45,230
Hey!
Anything?

175
00:11:46,189 --> 00:11:47,232
You?

176
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:50,443
No, nothing but a dead phone.

177
00:11:50,527 --> 00:11:51,528
Joyce?

178
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:54,364
About one step from falling off the edge.

179
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,866
She's been a few steps
for a while now, hasn't she?

180
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,701
Kid's missing, man.

181
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:00,078
Show a little class.

182
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:03,581
All right. Come on, let's go!

183
00:12:03,665 --> 00:12:05,917
We got a lot of ground to cover.

184
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,419
The chief and her,
they've screwed before, huh?

185
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:12,632
Will!

186
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:14,175
That a "yeah" or did they...

187
00:12:15,218 --> 00:12:17,303
- Will!
- Will!

188
00:12:24,853 --> 00:12:28,273
"When alpha particles go through
gold foil, they become..."

189
00:12:28,356 --> 00:12:30,900
- Unoccupied space.
- "A molecule that can..."

190
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,068
- Hey!
- I don't know,

191
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,444
I think you've studied enough, Nance.

192
00:12:33,528 --> 00:12:35,572
- Steve...
- I'm telling you, you know, you got this.

193
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:37,991
Don't worry.
Now, on to more important matters.

194
00:12:38,074 --> 00:12:41,035
My dad has left town on a conference
and my mom's gone with him,

195
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:43,538
- 'cause, you know, she doesn't trust him.
- Good call.

196
00:12:43,621 --> 00:12:44,622
So are you in?

197
00:12:44,706 --> 00:12:46,124
In for what?

198
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,959
No parents? Big house?

199
00:12:48,626 --> 00:12:49,752
A party?

200
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,754
Ding, ding, ding!

201
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,298
It's Tuesday.

202
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:54,841
It's Tuesday!
Oh, my God.

203
00:12:54,924 --> 00:12:56,259
Come on.

204
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,094
It'll be low key.
It'll just be us.

205
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,555
What do you say?
Are you in or are you out?

206
00:13:00,638 --> 00:13:04,475
- Um...
- Oh, God. Look.

207
00:13:05,476 --> 00:13:07,186
Oh, God, that's depressing.

208
00:13:09,397 --> 00:13:12,650
- Should we say something?
- I don't think he speaks.

209
00:13:12,734 --> 00:13:14,485
How much you want to bet he killed him?

210
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:15,820
Shut up.

211
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:24,621
Hey.

212
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:26,289
Oh, hey.

213
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,540
I just...

214
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:32,003
I wanted to say, you know, um...

215
00:13:32,086 --> 00:13:34,005
I'm sorry about everything.

216
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:41,721
Everyone's thinking about you.

217
00:13:43,848 --> 00:13:46,517
- It sucks.
- Yeah.

218
00:13:50,021 --> 00:13:51,272
I'm sure he's fine.

219
00:13:51,356 --> 00:13:53,024
He's a smart kid.

220
00:13:55,944 --> 00:13:57,820
I have to go.
Chemistry test.

221
00:13:57,904 --> 00:13:58,905
Yeah.

222
00:13:58,988 --> 00:14:00,448
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

223
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,789
<i>Attention, faculty and students.</i>

224
00:14:07,872 --> 00:14:11,334
<i>At 8:00 p.m. tonight, there will be
an assembly on the football field</i>

225
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,753
<i>in support of Will Byers and his family.</i>

226
00:14:13,836 --> 00:14:15,964
<i>All are encouraged to attend.</i>

227
00:14:16,047 --> 00:14:20,218
<i>Volunteer sign-ups for search parties
are still available in the office.</i>

228
00:14:26,391 --> 00:14:27,600
Oh, this is weird.

229
00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:31,062
- He's never this late.
- I'm telling you, his stupid plan failed.

230
00:14:31,145 --> 00:14:32,397
I thought you liked his plan.

231
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,816
Yeah, but obviously it was stupid,
or he'd be here.

232
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:36,859
If his mom found out
a girl spent the night...

233
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:38,444
He's in deep shit right about now.

234
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:41,197
Hey, what if she slept naked?

235
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:43,199
Oh, my God, she didn't.

236
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:45,493
Oh, if Mrs. Wheeler tells my parents...

237
00:14:45,576 --> 00:14:48,454
- No way. Mike would never rat us out.
- I don't know.

238
00:14:48,538 --> 00:14:51,749
All that matters is, after school,
the freak will be back in the loony bin,

239
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,961
and we can focus on what really matters,
finding Will.

240
00:15:11,102 --> 00:15:12,312
<i>You want anything to drink?</i>

241
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:15,064
We have OJ, skim milk...
What else?

242
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,775
Um, we have...

243
00:15:19,694 --> 00:15:21,446
Oh, this is my living room.

244
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:23,072
It's mostly just for watching TV.

245
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:25,700
Nice, right?
It's a 22-inch.

246
00:15:25,783 --> 00:15:27,869
That's, like, ten times bigger
than Dustin's.

247
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:41,591
- Pretty.
- I guess.

248
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,092
That's my sister Nancy.

249
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:44,802
And that's baby Holly.

250
00:15:44,886 --> 00:15:46,262
And those are my parents.

251
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:48,056
What are your parents like?

252
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,099
Do they live close?

253
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,103
That's our La-Z-Boy.

254
00:15:55,813 --> 00:15:57,065
It's where my dad sleeps.

255
00:15:57,148 --> 00:15:59,859
You can try it if you want.

256
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:01,527
Yeah.

257
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:03,863
It's fun.

258
00:16:07,492 --> 00:16:09,327
Just trust me, okay?

259
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,834
See? Fun, right?

260
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:19,712
Now you try.

261
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,090
- You like it?
- Yeah, it's cool.

262
00:17:04,173 --> 00:17:05,842
All right, you can keep
the mix if you want.

263
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:07,051
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

264
00:17:07,135 --> 00:17:08,719
All the best stuff's on there.

265
00:17:08,803 --> 00:17:11,722
Joy Division, Bowie, Television,
The Smiths...

266
00:17:11,806 --> 00:17:13,516
It'll totally change your life.

267
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,268
Yeah, totally.

268
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:17,437
Where the hell are you, Lonnie?

269
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,980
I don't want to hear it.
I don't want to hear it.

270
00:17:23,734 --> 00:17:27,822
This is ridiculous!
I'm so sick of your excuses.

271
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,285
He's not coming, is he?

272
00:17:33,995 --> 00:17:35,371
Do you even like baseball?

273
00:17:36,497 --> 00:17:38,708
No, but... I don't know.

274
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,793
- It's fun to go with him sometimes.
- Come on.

275
00:17:40,877 --> 00:17:43,629
Has he ever done anything with you
that you actually like?

276
00:17:43,713 --> 00:17:45,465
You know, like the arcade or something?

277
00:17:46,257 --> 00:17:48,968
- I don't know.
- No, all right? He hasn't.

278
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:50,887
He's trying to force you
to like normal things.

279
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,015
And you shouldn't like things because
people tell you you're supposed to.

280
00:17:54,098 --> 00:17:55,391
Okay?

281
00:17:56,184 --> 00:17:57,894
Especially not him.

282
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:02,148
But you like The Clash? For real?

283
00:18:02,231 --> 00:18:04,358
For real.
Definitely.

284
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:44,106
Joyce, I wasn't
expecting you today.

285
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,318
- I brought Jeffrey in to cover.
- I'm not here to work.

286
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:48,819
I...

287
00:18:48,903 --> 00:18:51,030
The storm last night, I...

288
00:18:51,656 --> 00:18:53,824
I need a new phone.

289
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:58,454
Okay, that looks like $22.56.

290
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:00,331
Uh, yeah, you know, uh...

291
00:19:00,414 --> 00:19:02,708
I gave Jonathan all my money for...

292
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:04,585
for the copies for the posters.

293
00:19:05,586 --> 00:19:08,047
Uh, I need an advance.

294
00:19:08,965 --> 00:19:10,466
Yes, well, of course.

295
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,134
- Of course.
- Thank you.

296
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:19,559
Yeah, uh, I was thinking,
two weeks?

297
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:23,062
Um...

298
00:19:24,855 --> 00:19:28,192
Yes, I understand, but, you know,
I have to pay Jeffrey for covering...

299
00:19:28,276 --> 00:19:29,277
Donald.

300
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,572
I've been here ten years, right?

301
00:19:32,655 --> 00:19:36,617
Have I ever called in sick
or missed a shift once?

302
00:19:36,701 --> 00:19:40,079
I've worked, uh,
Christmas Eve and Thanksgiving.

303
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:43,583
I don't know
where my boy is.

304
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:44,875
He's gone.

305
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:49,005
I don't know if I'm...
gonna ever see him again, if he's hurt...

306
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,091
I, uh...

307
00:19:53,634 --> 00:19:57,346
I need this phone
and two weeks' advance.

308
00:20:00,975 --> 00:20:02,727
And a pack of Camels.

309
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,031
- We're all clear.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

310
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,006
Extraordinary.

311
00:21:17,385 --> 00:21:19,845
Ready are you?
What knows you of ready?

312
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:21,222
His name's Yoda.

313
00:21:21,305 --> 00:21:24,433
He can use the Force to move things
with his mind, like this.

314
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:25,851
Whoosh!

315
00:21:27,603 --> 00:21:29,313
Oh, this is my dinosaur, Rory.

316
00:21:29,397 --> 00:21:31,232
Look, he has a speaker in his mouth
so he can roar.

317
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,284
Oh, these are all my
science fair trophies.

318
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:44,704
We got first every year.

319
00:21:44,787 --> 00:21:47,498
Except for last year when we got third.

320
00:21:47,581 --> 00:21:49,667
Mr. Clarke said it was totally political.

321
00:22:09,645 --> 00:22:10,771
You know Will?

322
00:22:11,814 --> 00:22:15,943
Did you see him? Last night?
On the road?

323
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,617
We gotta go.

324
00:22:27,163 --> 00:22:29,206
I bought pizza
and macaroni.

325
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,833
- Okay.
- Okay.

326
00:22:34,336 --> 00:22:36,464
Ted? Is that you?

327
00:22:36,547 --> 00:22:37,756
Just me, Mom!

328
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,509
- Mike? What are you doing home?
- One second!

329
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,849
In here.
I'll be right back, okay?

330
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:49,643
Please, you have to get in,
or my mom, she'll find you.

331
00:22:49,727 --> 00:22:51,687
Do you understand?

332
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,355
I won't tell her about you.
I promise.

333
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:54,815
Promise?

334
00:22:54,899 --> 00:22:56,901
It means something that you can't break.

335
00:22:56,984 --> 00:22:58,903
- Ever.
- Michael?

336
00:22:59,528 --> 00:23:00,571
Please?

337
00:23:18,339 --> 00:23:19,632
Pop!

338
00:23:23,844 --> 00:23:25,179
Papa!

339
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:27,765
Papa!

340
00:23:27,848 --> 00:23:29,183
No!

341
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,227
Papa!

342
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,646
No! No!
No!

343
00:23:38,442 --> 00:23:39,485
Papa!

344
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:41,237
Papa!

345
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,738
Papa!

346
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,907
Papa!

347
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,158
Papa!

348
00:23:49,745 --> 00:23:50,788
Papa.

349
00:24:00,381 --> 00:24:02,800
I just... I don't feel good.

350
00:24:02,883 --> 00:24:05,553
I woke up and my head,
it really hurt bad,

351
00:24:05,636 --> 00:24:07,846
and my throat was all scratchy,
and I wanted to tell you,

352
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,306
but the last time I told you I was sick

353
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:11,308
- you made me go to school anyway, and...
- Michael.

354
00:24:11,392 --> 00:24:14,228
- Yeah?
- I'm not mad at you.

355
00:24:14,311 --> 00:24:17,606
- No?
- No, of course not.

356
00:24:19,942 --> 00:24:22,861
All this that's been going on with Will,

357
00:24:22,945 --> 00:24:25,072
I can't imagine
what it's been like for you.

358
00:24:26,407 --> 00:24:27,866
I just...

359
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:30,411
I want you to feel like
you can talk to me.

360
00:24:30,494 --> 00:24:34,248
I never want you to feel like you have
to hide anything from me.

361
00:24:34,331 --> 00:24:36,458
I'm here for you. Okay?

362
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:40,212
Is there someone else here?

363
00:24:41,922 --> 00:24:42,923
No.

364
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,427
Eleven?

365
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,095
Is everything okay?

366
00:24:48,178 --> 00:24:49,221
El?

367
00:24:53,642 --> 00:24:55,603
- Mike.
- Is everything okay?

368
00:24:58,564 --> 00:25:00,024
Are you sure?

369
00:25:01,317 --> 00:25:02,693
Promise.

370
00:25:38,729 --> 00:25:42,232
- Will Byers!
- Will!

371
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:45,861
Whoa, whoa.
Careful, careful.

372
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:48,155
I need you alive for the next few days,
at least.

373
00:25:48,238 --> 00:25:50,491
Oh, hell, I could survive that.

374
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:53,702
What?
George Burness made the jump.

375
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:56,121
And he was drunk as a skunk.
He did it on a $10 bet.

376
00:25:56,205 --> 00:25:57,206
George is a liar.

377
00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:00,167
You make that jump from this height,
that water turns into cement.

378
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,753
Hits you like a ton of bricks.
Break every damn bone in your body.

379
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:07,049
Nah.

380
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,926
<i>Chief, you copy?</i>

381
00:26:10,511 --> 00:26:12,012
Yeah, Flo, talk to me.

382
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:14,848
<i>Hey, Chief, we got a call
from over at Benny's.</i>

383
00:26:14,932 --> 00:26:16,767
<i>I think you need to get there right away.</i>

384
00:26:39,707 --> 00:26:41,208
Ugh, Jesus!

385
00:26:47,381 --> 00:26:48,507
Suicide?

386
00:26:49,967 --> 00:26:51,468
Mmm-hmm.

387
00:26:51,552 --> 00:26:53,637
Missing kid, suicide...

388
00:26:53,721 --> 00:26:56,432
You must feel like a big city cop again,
huh, Chief?

389
00:26:58,142 --> 00:27:00,894
Well, I mostly dealt
with strangers back then.

390
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,149
Benny was my friend.

391
00:27:41,935 --> 00:27:43,228
Hello?

392
00:27:44,521 --> 00:27:45,731
Yeah.

393
00:27:48,859 --> 00:27:51,153
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, is Lonnie around?

394
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,238
- Yeah, he's out back. What do you want?
- To look around.

395
00:27:53,322 --> 00:27:55,824
- Hey, what do you think you're doing? Hey!
- I'll be fast.

396
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:57,242
Hey, Will?

397
00:27:57,326 --> 00:27:58,702
Will!

398
00:27:58,786 --> 00:28:00,871
Will, you here?
Will!

399
00:28:05,793 --> 00:28:07,002
Get off!

400
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:09,755
Damn, you've gotten stronger.

401
00:28:09,838 --> 00:28:11,965
Will someone please explain
what the hell is going on?

402
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:16,220
Jonathan, Cynthia.
Cynthia, this is Jonathan.

403
00:28:16,303 --> 00:28:17,304
My oldest.

404
00:28:19,389 --> 00:28:22,267
- Come here.
- Get off me, man.

405
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,741
- Are you out of your mind?
- Just listen to me.

406
00:28:37,825 --> 00:28:39,618
- You are out of your mind!
- She knows about Will.

407
00:28:39,701 --> 00:28:41,411
What do you mean she knows about Will?

408
00:28:42,538 --> 00:28:45,582
She pointed at him, at his picture.
She knew he was missing. I could tell.

409
00:28:45,666 --> 00:28:47,543
- You could tell?
- Just think about it.

410
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:49,837
Do you really think it was a coincidence
that we found her on Mirkwood,

411
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,547
the same place where Will disappeared?

412
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,924
- That is weird.
- And she said bad people are after her.

413
00:28:54,007 --> 00:28:57,302
I think maybe these bad people
are the same ones that took Will.

414
00:28:57,386 --> 00:29:00,764
- I think she knows what happened to him.
- Then why doesn't she tell us?

415
00:29:02,933 --> 00:29:04,977
Do you know where he is?

416
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,061
Do you know where Will is?

417
00:29:06,145 --> 00:29:08,480
- Stop it, you're scaring her!
- She should be scared!

418
00:29:08,564 --> 00:29:11,441
If you know where he is, tell us!

419
00:29:12,776 --> 00:29:15,320
This is nuts.
We have to take her to your mom.

420
00:29:15,404 --> 00:29:17,823
No! Eleven said telling any adult
would put us in danger.

421
00:29:17,906 --> 00:29:20,325
- What kind of danger?
- Her name is Eleven?

422
00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:22,911
- El for short.
- Mike, what kind of danger?

423
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:24,621
Danger danger.

424
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,379
No, no, no!

425
00:29:32,462 --> 00:29:35,215
We're going back to plan A.
We're telling your mom.

426
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:47,895
No.

427
00:29:54,109 --> 00:29:56,820
Take a look at this beaut.
Should've seen it when I got it.

428
00:29:56,904 --> 00:29:58,780
Took me a year, but it's almost done.

429
00:29:59,781 --> 00:30:02,659
Really?
You want to check up my ass, too?

430
00:30:03,327 --> 00:30:05,162
I told you the same thing
as I told those cops,

431
00:30:05,245 --> 00:30:06,830
he's not here and he never has been.

432
00:30:06,914 --> 00:30:09,917
- Then why didn't you call Mom back?
- I don't know, I just...

433
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,502
I assumed she just forgot where he was.

434
00:30:12,586 --> 00:30:14,129
You know, he was lost or something.

435
00:30:15,172 --> 00:30:17,466
That boy never was very good
at taking care of himself.

436
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,677
This isn't some joke, all right?
There are search parties, reporters...

437
00:30:20,761 --> 00:30:22,095
Hopper's not still chief, is he?

438
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:27,309
Tell your mother
she's gotta get you out of that hellhole.

439
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,353
Come out here to the city.

440
00:30:29,436 --> 00:30:31,063
People are more real here, you know?

441
00:30:32,439 --> 00:30:33,857
And then I could see you more.

442
00:30:36,026 --> 00:30:38,487
- What, you think I don't want to see you?
- I know you don't.

443
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,614
See, that's your mother talkin'
right there.

444
00:30:41,865 --> 00:30:42,991
She even know you're here?

445
00:30:44,034 --> 00:30:45,035
Oh, great.

446
00:30:45,118 --> 00:30:47,829
So one kid goes missing,
the other one runs wild?

447
00:30:47,913 --> 00:30:49,706
Some real fine parenting right there.

448
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:53,543
Look, all I'm saying is,
maybe I'm not the asshole, all right?

449
00:30:58,257 --> 00:30:59,925
In case you forgot what he looks like.

450
00:31:03,512 --> 00:31:05,264
He's kinda cute, hmm?

451
00:31:05,347 --> 00:31:07,391
Maybe I'll trade you in
for the younger model?

452
00:31:09,851 --> 00:31:11,395
Just doesn't make any sense, Chief.

453
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,358
You, uh, notice anything...

454
00:31:17,401 --> 00:31:18,777
odd about him the last few weeks?

455
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:22,114
No, we're fixin' to go fishing
down the Etowah next Sunday.

456
00:31:22,197 --> 00:31:24,324
I mean, he was lookin' forward to it.
I know that.

457
00:31:24,408 --> 00:31:26,618
He got any enemies you might know about?

458
00:31:26,702 --> 00:31:28,787
I mean,
people who might not want him around?

459
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,873
The exes didn't like him much.
That's for sure, but...

460
00:31:32,874 --> 00:31:34,418
nah.

461
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:38,255
- When was the last time you saw him?
- Yesterday. Lunch, same as always.

462
00:31:38,338 --> 00:31:40,590
- Just you and the boys?
- Yep.

463
00:31:40,674 --> 00:31:42,759
Me and Henry and...

464
00:31:44,052 --> 00:31:46,596
Well, there was this, uh, this kid.

465
00:31:47,597 --> 00:31:48,724
No kid did this.

466
00:31:49,683 --> 00:31:50,726
Kid?

467
00:31:52,144 --> 00:31:53,603
What are you talking about?

468
00:31:53,687 --> 00:31:58,608
Yeah. At lunch, uh,
there was this boy that, uh...

469
00:31:58,692 --> 00:32:01,445
I mean, he was trying to steal
food out of Benny's kitchen.

470
00:32:01,528 --> 00:32:02,904
Can you imagine that?

471
00:32:05,866 --> 00:32:06,908
This kid...

472
00:32:08,535 --> 00:32:09,661
what'd he look like?

473
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:14,124
Well, he was about yea high.
You know, tiny like.

474
00:32:14,207 --> 00:32:16,585
I didn't get a good look at him, though.
He was back in the kitchen.

475
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:18,128
He look like this?

476
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,840
Oh, no, that's...
That's Lonnie's missin' kid.

477
00:32:21,923 --> 00:32:23,967
No. This was a different kid.

478
00:32:24,051 --> 00:32:25,510
This one had really short hair.

479
00:32:25,594 --> 00:32:27,679
I mean, it was buzzed
nearly down to the scalp.

480
00:32:27,763 --> 00:32:30,390
Yeah, well, let's...
You know, let's forget about the haircut.

481
00:32:30,474 --> 00:32:33,560
I mean, if this kid had a buzz cut...

482
00:32:33,643 --> 00:32:35,020
could it be Lonnie's kid?

483
00:32:35,771 --> 00:32:38,065
Well, I...
I didn't get a good look at him.

484
00:32:40,067 --> 00:32:42,027
About the right height, though.

485
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,779
I mean, could've been.

486
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:46,531
Yeah, that's...

487
00:32:46,615 --> 00:32:47,616
Could've been.

488
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:53,830
Because I don't want to go by myself.

489
00:32:53,914 --> 00:32:57,084
Barb...
Barb, it's not rocket science.

490
00:32:57,167 --> 00:33:00,545
You just tell your parents you're gonna
stay at my place afterwards.

491
00:33:00,629 --> 00:33:03,507
No, tell them we're... studying.

492
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,300
Nancy! Dinner!

493
00:33:05,384 --> 00:33:07,094
Coming!

494
00:33:07,177 --> 00:33:09,846
Look, I gotta go.
I'll see you in an hour.

495
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:21,191
Something wrong with the meatloaf?

496
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:25,112
Oh, no, I had two
bologna sandwiches for lunch.

497
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:27,906
I don't know why.

498
00:33:27,989 --> 00:33:29,866
Me, too.

499
00:33:31,076 --> 00:33:33,412
- It's delicious, Mommy.
- Thank you, sweetie.

500
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:35,872
So, there's this...

501
00:33:35,956 --> 00:33:38,458
special assembly thing tonight...

502
00:33:38,542 --> 00:33:40,836
for Will at the school field.

503
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:41,920
Barb's driving.

504
00:33:42,003 --> 00:33:44,172
Why am I just hearing about this?

505
00:33:45,048 --> 00:33:46,091
I thought you knew.

506
00:33:46,174 --> 00:33:49,261
I told you, I don't want you
out after dark until Will is found.

507
00:33:49,344 --> 00:33:52,681
I know, I know, but it'd be
super weird if I'm not there.

508
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,808
I mean, everyone's going.

509
00:33:58,061 --> 00:33:59,980
Just... be back by 10:00.

510
00:34:01,398 --> 00:34:02,566
Why don't you take the boys, too?

511
00:34:02,649 --> 00:34:03,859
- No!
- Mmm-mmm.

512
00:34:05,527 --> 00:34:07,612
Don't you think you should be there?
For Will?

513
00:34:11,658 --> 00:34:13,910
Sorry. Spasm.

514
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:20,041
Oh...

515
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:21,334
It's okay, Holly.

516
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:23,253
- It's just a loud noise.
- Nice.

517
00:34:24,963 --> 00:34:27,257
Will!

518
00:34:29,342 --> 00:34:32,554
Better come out, buddy.
Will, where are ya?

519
00:34:42,898 --> 00:34:45,775
Hey, you think
Earl really saw Will?

520
00:34:45,859 --> 00:34:48,820
I mean, what's he doin'
with a shaved head?

521
00:34:48,904 --> 00:34:50,489
And stealing food from Benny?

522
00:34:50,572 --> 00:34:53,241
Tell you what,
when we find him, we'll ask.

523
00:34:53,325 --> 00:34:54,951
Can't ask a corpse questions.

524
00:34:55,035 --> 00:34:56,828
Hold up!

525
00:34:56,912 --> 00:34:58,371
You got something?

526
00:35:01,541 --> 00:35:03,668
- Hey, what do you got?
- Not sure.

527
00:35:03,752 --> 00:35:05,670
Maybe nothing.

528
00:35:05,754 --> 00:35:07,672
I found this. In there.

529
00:35:12,385 --> 00:35:14,554
No way a kid
crawls through there.

530
00:35:15,597 --> 00:35:17,307
I don't know...

531
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:18,767
a scared enough one might.

532
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,228
His brother said he was good at hiding.

533
00:35:57,347 --> 00:35:58,348
El?

534
00:36:04,145 --> 00:36:07,107
No adults.
Just us and some meatloaf.

535
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:13,697
Don't worry.
They won't tell anyone about you.

536
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,199
They promise.
Right?

537
00:36:16,283 --> 00:36:18,827
We never would've upset you
if we knew you had superpowers.

538
00:36:20,161 --> 00:36:21,204
Ow!

539
00:36:21,288 --> 00:36:25,917
What Dustin is trying to say
is that they were just scared... earlier.

540
00:36:26,001 --> 00:36:27,043
That's all.

541
00:36:27,127 --> 00:36:29,045
We just wanted to find our friend.

542
00:36:29,629 --> 00:36:30,672
"Friend"?

543
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:33,633
Yeah, friend.
Will?

544
00:36:33,717 --> 00:36:37,012
What is "friend"?

545
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:38,513
Is she serious?

546
00:36:41,182 --> 00:36:42,601
Um, a friend...

547
00:36:42,684 --> 00:36:44,436
Is someone that you'd do anything for.

548
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:47,647
You lend them your cool stuff,
like comic books and trading cards.

549
00:36:47,731 --> 00:36:49,024
And they never break a promise.

550
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:51,026
- Especially when there's spit.
- Spit?

551
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:54,863
A spit swear means...
you never break your word.

552
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:56,364
It's a bond.

553
00:36:56,448 --> 00:37:00,118
That's super important, because friends...

554
00:37:00,201 --> 00:37:02,454
they tell each other things.

555
00:37:02,537 --> 00:37:04,289
Things that parents don't know.

556
00:37:11,129 --> 00:37:13,173
- Barbara, pull over.
- What?

557
00:37:13,256 --> 00:37:14,549
Pull over!

558
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,137
What are we doing here?

559
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,805
His house is three blocks away.

560
00:37:20,889 --> 00:37:22,349
We can't park in the driveway.

561
00:37:22,432 --> 00:37:23,475
Are you serious?

562
00:37:23,558 --> 00:37:24,684
Yeah, the neighbors might see.

563
00:37:24,768 --> 00:37:27,479
This is so stupid.
I'm just gonna drop you off.

564
00:37:27,562 --> 00:37:29,397
Calm down, Barb.
Come on.

565
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:32,025
You promised that you'd go.
You're coming.

566
00:37:32,108 --> 00:37:33,360
We're gonna have a great time.

567
00:37:33,443 --> 00:37:34,986
He just wants to get in your pants.

568
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,696
No, he doesn't.

569
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:39,074
Nance... seriously.

570
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,243
He invited you to his house.

571
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:44,245
His parents aren't home.

572
00:37:44,913 --> 00:37:46,581
Come on, you are not this stupid.

573
00:37:46,665 --> 00:37:48,667
Tommy H. and Carol are gonna be there.

574
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,836
Tommy and Carol have been
having sex since, like, seventh grade.

575
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:54,798
It'll probably just be, like, a big orgy.

576
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:57,842
- Gross.
- I'm serious!

577
00:37:57,926 --> 00:37:59,219
All right, well...

578
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:03,473
you can be, like, my guardian. All right?

579
00:38:03,556 --> 00:38:06,017
Make sure I don't get drunk
and do anything stupid.

580
00:38:06,101 --> 00:38:07,102
Ugh.

581
00:38:10,438 --> 00:38:11,648
Is that a new bra?

582
00:38:13,316 --> 00:38:14,442
No.

583
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:28,873
Barb, chill.

584
00:38:29,791 --> 00:38:31,167
I'm chill.

585
00:38:36,256 --> 00:38:37,632
Hello, ladies.

586
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:11,207
What are you doing?

587
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:13,710
It's freezing.

588
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:20,967
You ever feel cursed?

589
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:27,474
You know, the last person
to go missing here was in, uh...

590
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:30,852
the summer of '23.

591
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,814
The last suicide was the fall of '61.

592
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:42,572
When'd the last person freeze to death?

593
00:39:46,075 --> 00:39:48,286
Hey, come back inside.

594
00:39:48,369 --> 00:39:50,371
- Warm me up.
- Just...

595
00:39:52,999 --> 00:39:54,584
Just give me a minute out here.

596
00:40:21,277 --> 00:40:23,029
What's the weirdo doing?

597
00:40:29,077 --> 00:40:30,119
El?

598
00:40:43,716 --> 00:40:44,801
Will.

599
00:40:45,468 --> 00:40:46,469
Superpowers.

600
00:40:53,601 --> 00:40:56,521
Did you see him?
On Mirkwood?

601
00:40:57,939 --> 00:40:59,148
Do you know where he is?

602
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:16,749
I don't understand.

603
00:41:17,667 --> 00:41:18,835
Hiding.

604
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,587
Will is hiding?

605
00:41:25,341 --> 00:41:26,926
From the bad men?

606
00:41:29,846 --> 00:41:31,514
Then from who?

607
00:42:35,161 --> 00:42:36,704
Where are you?

608
00:43:05,775 --> 00:43:08,069
One! Two!

609
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:10,822
- Three!
- Stop it, Tommy, no! Don't!

610
00:43:10,905 --> 00:43:13,574
You're such an asshole, Tommy.

611
00:43:28,798 --> 00:43:30,508
Is that supposed to impress me?

612
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:34,387
- You're not?
- You are a cliché, you do realize that?

613
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:35,513
You are a cliché.

614
00:43:35,596 --> 00:43:38,016
What with your...
your grades and your band practice.

615
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:39,517
I'm so not in band.

616
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,520
Okay, party girl. Why don't you just, uh,
show us how it's done, then?

617
00:43:42,603 --> 00:43:43,604
Okay.

618
00:43:50,737 --> 00:43:52,655
- You gotta make a little hole right in...
- I got it.

619
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:54,949
Yeah, she's smart, you douche!

620
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:01,706
Chug, chug, chug.

621
00:44:01,789 --> 00:44:03,249
Chug. Chug. Chug.

622
00:44:15,803 --> 00:44:17,055
Barb, you wanna try?

623
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:19,432
What? No.

624
00:44:19,515 --> 00:44:20,767
No, I don't want to. Thanks.

625
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:21,976
- Come on.
- Yeah...

626
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,394
- Come on. Yeah.
- Nance, I don't want to.

627
00:44:23,478 --> 00:44:25,188
- It's fun! Just give it a...
- Nance...

628
00:44:25,271 --> 00:44:26,939
Just... Just give it a shot.

629
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:30,193
Okay.

630
00:44:35,782 --> 00:44:36,908
So you just...

631
00:44:41,621 --> 00:44:43,664
- Gnarly.
- Are you okay?

632
00:44:43,748 --> 00:44:45,208
- Yeah.
- Barb, you're bleeding.

633
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:47,251
I'm fine.
Where's your bathroom?

634
00:44:47,335 --> 00:44:49,921
Oh, it's... It's, uh, down past
the kitchen, to the left.

635
00:44:50,004 --> 00:44:51,589
Okay. Thanks.

636
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:56,093
Oh.

637
00:45:04,977 --> 00:45:08,105
Oh, my, God!
What the hell, Tommy?

638
00:45:08,189 --> 00:45:09,190
No!

639
00:45:10,817 --> 00:45:12,735
Whoo!

640
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:53,943
Hello?

641
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:58,739
Hello.

642
00:45:58,823 --> 00:46:00,658
Who is this?

643
00:46:03,744 --> 00:46:05,997
Will?

644
00:46:07,456 --> 00:46:10,209
Will, it's me.

645
00:46:10,293 --> 00:46:12,044
Talk to me.

646
00:46:12,128 --> 00:46:13,504
I'm here.

647
00:46:13,588 --> 00:46:15,464
Just tell me where you are, honey.

648
00:46:15,548 --> 00:46:17,508
I can hear you. Please.

649
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:20,177
<i>Mom?</i>

650
00:46:20,261 --> 00:46:21,637
Will!

651
00:46:21,721 --> 00:46:25,349
Yes, it's me.
It's me.

652
00:46:25,433 --> 00:46:27,727
Where are you? Where are you?
Just talk to me...

653
00:46:30,396 --> 00:46:31,439
Oh, no, no!

654
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:32,565
No!

655
00:46:32,648 --> 00:46:34,150
No!

656
00:46:34,233 --> 00:46:36,944
Oh, no! No, no...

657
00:46:39,822 --> 00:46:41,115
No!

658
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:49,081
No!

659
00:47:05,598 --> 00:47:06,974
Jonathan?

660
00:47:09,602 --> 00:47:10,603
What...

661
00:47:42,301 --> 00:47:43,344
Will...

662
00:47:55,523 --> 00:47:57,108
Will...

663
00:47:58,234 --> 00:47:59,902
Will, is that you?

664
00:48:23,175 --> 00:48:24,552
Oh, my God.

665
00:48:27,263 --> 00:48:28,848
Oh, God...

666
00:48:31,809 --> 00:48:33,936
Oh, my God...

667
00:49:18,147 --> 00:49:20,024
I'm freezing.

668
00:49:20,107 --> 00:49:24,403
Hmm... well, I hear his
mom's room has a fireplace.

669
00:49:24,487 --> 00:49:25,738
- Are you kidding?
- Oh, yeah?

670
00:49:25,821 --> 00:49:28,157
Okay, well, you know,
you are cleaning the sheets.

671
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,492
- You all right?
- Yeah.

672
00:49:29,575 --> 00:49:32,244
Yeah?
Come on, let's get you some dry clothes.

673
00:49:37,792 --> 00:49:39,085
Nance!

674
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:40,503
Nancy.

675
00:49:41,462 --> 00:49:43,214
Where are you going?

676
00:49:43,297 --> 00:49:44,340
Nowhere.

677
00:49:44,423 --> 00:49:46,258
Just... upstairs.

678
00:49:46,342 --> 00:49:47,968
To change.

679
00:49:48,052 --> 00:49:50,805
I... fell in the pool.

680
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:55,434
Why don't you go ahead and go home.

681
00:49:55,518 --> 00:49:57,895
I'll just... I'll get a ride or something.

682
00:49:57,978 --> 00:49:59,355
Nance...

683
00:50:00,106 --> 00:50:01,816
Barb...

684
00:50:01,899 --> 00:50:03,484
I'm fine.

685
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:05,986
This isn't you.

686
00:50:07,113 --> 00:50:08,739
I'm fine.

687
00:50:08,823 --> 00:50:12,409
Just... go ahead and go home, okay?

688
00:50:32,304 --> 00:50:33,556
Thanks.

689
00:50:38,352 --> 00:50:39,895
Um...

690
00:50:39,979 --> 00:50:41,605
some privacy, maybe?

691
00:50:41,689 --> 00:50:43,190
Oh...

692
00:50:43,274 --> 00:50:44,900
Yeah, right.
Sorry.

693
00:50:49,655 --> 00:50:50,698
Steve?

694
00:51:04,712 --> 00:51:05,880
Damn.

695
00:51:08,215 --> 00:51:09,466
Shut up.
