00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,162


1
00:00:35,853 --> 00:00:37,938
This the wall
she was talking about, Chief?

2
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:50,117
A trooper found
something in the, uh...

3
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,995
water that's at the quarry.

4
00:00:53,078 --> 00:00:56,331
Our working theory right now
is that Will...

5
00:00:56,415 --> 00:01:00,961
crashed his bike, he...
made his way over the quarry and, uh...

6
00:01:01,044 --> 00:01:03,005
accidentally fell in.

7
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:06,467
The earth must have given way.

8
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:11,638
Joyce?

9
00:01:13,223 --> 00:01:15,100
Joyce?

10
00:01:15,184 --> 00:01:16,852
Do you understand what I'm saying?

11
00:01:16,935 --> 00:01:18,145
No.

12
00:01:19,354 --> 00:01:22,357
Whoever you found...

13
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:23,942
is not my boy.

14
00:01:24,026 --> 00:01:25,861
- It's not Will.
- Joyce.

15
00:01:25,944 --> 00:01:28,113
No, you don't understand.

16
00:01:29,072 --> 00:01:30,949
I talked to him...

17
00:01:31,033 --> 00:01:32,451
a half hour ago.

18
00:01:33,452 --> 00:01:35,621
He was... He was here.

19
00:01:35,704 --> 00:01:37,998
He was...
He was talking with these.

20
00:01:38,707 --> 00:01:39,708
- Talking?
- Uh-huh.

21
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:42,127
One blink for yes, two for no.

22
00:01:42,794 --> 00:01:44,713
And... And, uh...

23
00:01:44,796 --> 00:01:49,676
And then I made this
so he could talk to me.

24
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,095
'Cause he was hiding...

25
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:54,264
from that... that thing.

26
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:55,724
The thing that came out of the wall?

27
00:01:55,807 --> 00:01:57,017
- The thing that chased you?
- Yeah.

28
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,311
- Yeah.
- Mom, come on, please.

29
00:01:59,394 --> 00:02:01,438
- You've gotta stop this.
- No, maybe he's...

30
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:02,814
It's after him!

31
00:02:02,898 --> 00:02:06,360
- He's in danger. We have to find him! We...
- What exactly was this thing?

32
00:02:06,443 --> 00:02:07,819
It was some kind of animal, you said?

33
00:02:07,903 --> 00:02:08,904
Uh, no, it was...

34
00:02:08,987 --> 00:02:12,241
It was almost... human,
but it wasn't. It...

35
00:02:12,324 --> 00:02:16,370
It had these long arms and...
it didn't have a face.

36
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,372
It didn't have a face?

37
00:02:19,748 --> 00:02:21,875
- Joyce.
- It didn't have a face...

38
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:23,252
Joyce, listen to me.

39
00:02:23,335 --> 00:02:24,795
Listen to me.

40
00:02:27,923 --> 00:02:28,966
After Sarah...

41
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,970
I saw her, too.

42
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:34,137
And I heard her.

43
00:02:36,348 --> 00:02:39,017
I didn't know what was real.

44
00:02:39,101 --> 00:02:41,270
And then I figured out
that it was in my mind.

45
00:02:41,353 --> 00:02:43,397
And I had to pack all that away.

46
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,692
Otherwise, I was gonna fall down a hole...

47
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:48,568
that I couldn't get out of.

48
00:02:48,652 --> 00:02:52,489
No, you're...
you're talking about grief.

49
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:53,824
This is different.

50
00:02:54,783 --> 00:02:58,370
- I'm just saying that you...
- No, I know what you're saying, Hop.

51
00:02:58,453 --> 00:03:02,666
I swear to you,
I know what I saw.

52
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:05,002
And I'm not crazy.

53
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:06,920
I'm not saying that you're crazy.

54
00:03:07,004 --> 00:03:08,922
No...
You are.

55
00:03:09,006 --> 00:03:11,633
And I understand, but...

56
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:14,136
God, I...

57
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:16,805
I need you to believe me.

58
00:03:17,723 --> 00:03:19,933
Please.

59
00:03:20,017 --> 00:03:21,893
Please.

60
00:03:21,977 --> 00:03:22,978
Listen...

61
00:03:25,522 --> 00:03:28,358
I think you should go to the morgue
tomorrow and see him for yourself.

62
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:30,319
It'll give you the answers that you need.

63
00:03:30,402 --> 00:03:31,778
- But tonight...
- Oh, God.

64
00:03:31,862 --> 00:03:34,531
...I want you to try to get some sleep,
if you can.

65
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:36,903
<i>Byers' body was found
in the water of this quarry</i>

66
00:05:36,987 --> 00:05:39,072
<i>by state police earlier this evening.</i>

67
00:05:39,156 --> 00:05:42,909
<i>It was discovered by state trooper
David O'Bannon, just after dark.</i>

68
00:05:42,993 --> 00:05:44,911
<i>The state police
are mounting an investigation</i>

69
00:05:44,995 --> 00:05:46,872
<i>to determine Byers' cause of death,</i>

70
00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:48,331
<i>but an initial inquiry...</i>

71
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,959
Should I go down and talk to Michael?

72
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,213
Give him time.

73
00:05:55,297 --> 00:05:57,048
He'll come to us when he's ready.

74
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:16,568
Can you please stop that?

75
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,325
Are you deaf?

76
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:26,578
I thought we were friends, you know?

77
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:28,497
But friends tell each other the truth.

78
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,207
And they definitely don't lie
to each other.

79
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,126
You made me think Will was okay,
that he was still out there,

80
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,170
but he wasn't.
He wasn't!

81
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,257
Maybe you thought you were helping,
but you weren't.

82
00:06:39,341 --> 00:06:42,552
You hurt me.
Do you understand?

83
00:06:43,053 --> 00:06:44,888
What you did sucks.

84
00:06:46,765 --> 00:06:48,642
Lucas was right about you.

85
00:06:49,434 --> 00:06:50,644
All along.

86
00:07:20,382 --> 00:07:22,926
Will, is that you? It's Mike!
Do you copy?

87
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,135
Over.

88
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:27,722
Will, are you there?

89
00:07:27,806 --> 00:07:29,683
Will!

90
00:07:36,106 --> 00:07:37,649
Was that...

91
00:07:37,732 --> 00:07:38,775
Was it...

92
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:43,738
Will.

93
00:08:28,757 --> 00:08:32,085


94
00:08:59,981 --> 00:09:01,274
<i>Mom...</i>

95
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,573
Mom!

96
00:09:08,657 --> 00:09:10,075
Mom! Wake up.

97
00:09:10,158 --> 00:09:12,202
What... what time is it?

98
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,955
It's almost 8:00.
We have to go.

99
00:09:15,038 --> 00:09:17,374
Go where? Where?

100
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,626
To see Will.

101
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:24,714
Michael?

102
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,927
Hi, honey.
How are you feeling?

103
00:09:30,053 --> 00:09:31,596
I, uh...

104
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,557
I don't think I can go to school today.

105
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,351
Oh, that's fine, sweetie.

106
00:09:36,434 --> 00:09:39,688
I need to drop off Nance,
then I'm gonna check in on Barb's parents.

107
00:09:39,771 --> 00:09:42,107
Why don't you grab a book
or something and come with me?

108
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,234
We can stop by the video store
on the way back,

109
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,653
pick out whatever you want.
Even R-rated.

110
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:49,489
I think I just want to stay home today.

111
00:09:49,572 --> 00:09:51,032
I mean, if that's okay?

112
00:09:51,116 --> 00:09:54,411
Well, are you sure you're gonna be
all right here by yourself?

113
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:55,954
I think so.

114
00:09:56,037 --> 00:09:58,915
Okay.

115
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:01,334
But if you need anything,
call Dad at work.

116
00:10:01,418 --> 00:10:03,294
- Okay.
- Okay.

117
00:10:06,214 --> 00:10:07,257
Bye.

118
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,842
Bye, sweetie.

119
00:10:14,472 --> 00:10:15,682
Lucas, do you copy?

120
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:18,977
<i>Lucas, come on, I know you're there!</i>

121
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,770
This is urgent.
I'm serious.

122
00:10:23,648 --> 00:10:26,192
I'm not gonna stop until you answer.

123
00:10:26,276 --> 00:10:27,694
Lucas.

124
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:29,237
Lucas!

125
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,114
Lucas, Lucas, Lucas,
Lucas, Lucas...

126
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,491
<i>Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas,
Lucas, Lucas, Lucas...</i>

127
00:10:33,575 --> 00:10:35,035
Go away, Mike.

128
00:10:35,118 --> 00:10:38,121
I'm not in the mood, all right?
Over and out.

129
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:39,581
<i>No, not "out."</i>

130
00:10:39,664 --> 00:10:42,125
I'm not messing around, okay?
This is about Will.

131
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,127
<i>- Over.</i>
- What about Will?

132
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:46,629
You mean about his funeral?
Over.

133
00:10:46,755 --> 00:10:47,881
No, not his funeral.

134
00:10:47,964 --> 00:10:49,466
- Screw his funeral!
- What?

135
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:51,843
Just get over here stat.
And bring Dustin.

136
00:10:51,926 --> 00:10:53,219
Over and out.

137
00:10:56,431 --> 00:10:58,349
What's taking so long?

138
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:02,520
Well, everything's been a bit chaotic
around here without Gary.

139
00:11:03,313 --> 00:11:04,481
Without Gary?

140
00:11:05,482 --> 00:11:07,650
- Where's Gary?
- Well, I thought you knew.

141
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:11,112
Those men from State, they...
they sent Gary home last night.

142
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:14,574
So who did the autopsy?

143
00:11:15,158 --> 00:11:16,743
Someone from State.

144
00:11:42,852 --> 00:11:45,730
He has a birth mark on his right arm.

145
00:11:45,814 --> 00:11:47,524
Can you show that to me, please?

146
00:11:52,987 --> 00:11:54,239
How's your mom doing?

147
00:11:57,659 --> 00:11:58,910
I don't know.

148
00:12:00,495 --> 00:12:03,373
How long's this stuff been going on?
With the lights and, uh...

149
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,667
Will and the thing in the wall?

150
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,630
Since the first phone call, I guess.

151
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,303
You know, she's had anxiety problems...

152
00:12:17,387 --> 00:12:18,596
in the past.

153
00:12:20,181 --> 00:12:21,599
But this...

154
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:24,310
I don't know.

155
00:12:29,023 --> 00:12:31,109
I'm worried it could be...

156
00:12:32,694 --> 00:12:34,112
Ugh, I don't know.

157
00:12:38,575 --> 00:12:39,993
She'll be okay.

158
00:12:41,077 --> 00:12:42,412
We'll be okay.

159
00:12:45,748 --> 00:12:47,166
My mom...

160
00:12:50,044 --> 00:12:51,880
she's tough.

161
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:53,464
Yeah, she is.

162
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:57,385
Hey.

163
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:00,179
She is.

164
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,392
Ma'am!

165
00:13:04,475 --> 00:13:06,019
- Ma'am, I need you to sign!
- I don't...

166
00:13:06,102 --> 00:13:09,898
I don't know what you think that thing
is in there, but that is not my son!

167
00:13:09,981 --> 00:13:11,733
- Joyce, wait a second.
- No!

168
00:13:11,816 --> 00:13:13,943
- Mom!
- Ma'am, I... Ma'am!

169
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:21,242
So, wait a sec. I don't understand.
You went back to my house?

170
00:13:21,326 --> 00:13:22,702
To look for Barb.

171
00:13:22,785 --> 00:13:24,871
Yeah, okay, but why didn't you
just talk to me?

172
00:13:24,954 --> 00:13:26,581
That's crazy.

173
00:13:26,664 --> 00:13:29,500
I don't know, I... I was scared.

174
00:13:29,584 --> 00:13:32,211
You seriously think
you saw a guy in a mask

175
00:13:32,295 --> 00:13:33,963
just hanging out in my yard?

176
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,798
I don't think it was a mask.

177
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:37,675
But he had no face?

178
00:13:38,843 --> 00:13:40,678
I don't know!

179
00:13:40,762 --> 00:13:42,639
I don't know, I just...

180
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:45,308
I have a terrible feeling about this.

181
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,434
Oh, this is bad.

182
00:13:46,517 --> 00:13:48,061
This is really bad.

183
00:13:48,144 --> 00:13:49,187
What?

184
00:13:50,104 --> 00:13:51,147
The cops...

185
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,983
they're gonna want to talk
to all of us now.

186
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:57,570
Tommy, Carol,
everybody who was at the party.

187
00:13:57,654 --> 00:13:59,614
- So?
- My parents are gonna murder me!

188
00:14:00,615 --> 00:14:02,659
Are you serious right now?

189
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:04,827
You don't understand.
My dad's a grade-A asshole.

190
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:08,414
Barb is missing!
And you're worried about your dad?

191
00:14:08,498 --> 00:14:11,834
Okay, just...
When you talk to the cops, just...

192
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:13,836
don't mention the beers.

193
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,713
It's just gonna get us both in trouble,

194
00:14:15,797 --> 00:14:17,924
and Barbara's got nothing to do with it,
okay?

195
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:20,969
I can't believe you right now.

196
00:14:22,053 --> 00:14:24,055
- I can't believe you.
- Nancy.

197
00:14:25,682 --> 00:14:27,058
Nancy, wait!

198
00:14:28,518 --> 00:14:29,978
Nancy!

199
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:32,939
- Mom, will you get in?
- No, I...

200
00:14:33,022 --> 00:14:35,441
I need to think.
Just go on home.

201
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:37,485
Mom, will you just get in, please?

202
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:41,781
Mom.

203
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:44,617
Mom!

204
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:48,079
Mom.

205
00:14:48,162 --> 00:14:50,540
- Stop.
- Just go home, Jonathan.

206
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,376
No, this is not an okay time
for you to shut down.

207
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,878
- Shut down? What...
- We have to deal with this, Mom.

208
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:57,672
We have to deal with the funeral!

209
00:14:57,755 --> 00:14:59,215
The funeral?

210
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:02,218
For... for who?
For that thing back there?

211
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:04,345
Okay, let me get this straight.

212
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:07,598
Will, that's not his body,
because he's in the lights, right?

213
00:15:07,682 --> 00:15:09,517
And there's a monster in the wall?

214
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,102
Do you even hear yourself?

215
00:15:12,061 --> 00:15:14,105
I know it sounds crazy.

216
00:15:14,188 --> 00:15:15,523
I sound crazy!

217
00:15:15,606 --> 00:15:17,400
- Yeah.
- You think I don't know that?

218
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:18,651
It is crazy!

219
00:15:18,735 --> 00:15:20,570
But I heard him, Jonathan.

220
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,322
He talked to me!

221
00:15:22,405 --> 00:15:25,241
Will is... is calling to me!

222
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:29,203
And he's out there, and he's alone,
and he's scared, and I...

223
00:15:29,287 --> 00:15:31,247
I don't care if anyone believes me!

224
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:35,918
I am not gonna stop looking for him
until I find him and bring him home.

225
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:39,088
I am going to bring him home!

226
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:41,966
Yeah, well,
while you're talking to the lights,

227
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:44,552
the rest of us are having
a funeral for Will!

228
00:15:44,635 --> 00:15:47,680
I'm not letting him sit in that freezer
another day!

229
00:15:51,434 --> 00:15:53,102
All right, show's over.

230
00:15:55,104 --> 00:15:56,147
What?

231
00:16:09,494 --> 00:16:12,246
We keep losing the signal,
but you heard it, right?

232
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,749
Yeah, I heard a baby.

233
00:16:14,832 --> 00:16:15,875
What?

234
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,753
Mike, you obviously tapped
into a baby monitor.

235
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:20,421
It's probably the Blackburns' next door.

236
00:16:20,505 --> 00:16:22,298
Uh, did that sound like a baby to you?

237
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:23,674
- That was Will!
- Mike...

238
00:16:23,758 --> 00:16:25,968
Lucas, you don't understand.
He spoke last night.

239
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:27,261
Words!

240
00:16:27,345 --> 00:16:30,098
He was singing that weird song he loves.
Even El heard him!

241
00:16:30,181 --> 00:16:32,392
Oh, well, if the weirdo heard him,
then I guess...

242
00:16:32,475 --> 00:16:33,726
Are you sure you're on the right channel?

243
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:34,811
I don't think it's about that.

244
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:38,564
I think, somehow, she's channeling him.

245
00:16:39,148 --> 00:16:41,317
- Like... like Professor X.
- Yeah.

246
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,069
Are you actually believing this crap?

247
00:16:43,986 --> 00:16:45,029
I don't know, I mean...

248
00:16:45,113 --> 00:16:47,949
Do you remember when Will
fell off his bike and broke his finger?

249
00:16:48,032 --> 00:16:50,243
He sounded a lot like that.

250
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,371
Did you guys not see what I saw?

251
00:16:53,454 --> 00:16:55,706
They pulled Will's body out of the water.

252
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,333
He's dead!

253
00:16:59,669 --> 00:17:02,130
Well, maybe it's his ghost.
Maybe he's haunting us.

254
00:17:02,213 --> 00:17:03,881
- It's not his ghost.
- So how do you know that?

255
00:17:03,965 --> 00:17:05,633
- I just do!
- Then what was in that water?

256
00:17:05,716 --> 00:17:06,801
I don't know!

257
00:17:06,884 --> 00:17:09,095
All I know is Will is alive.

258
00:17:09,178 --> 00:17:10,638
Will is alive!

259
00:17:10,721 --> 00:17:12,056
He's out there somewhere.

260
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,766
All we have to do is find him.

261
00:17:20,356 --> 00:17:21,899
This isn't gonna work.

262
00:17:21,983 --> 00:17:23,860
We need to get El to a stronger radio.

263
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,946
- Mr. Clarke's Heathkit ham shack.
- Yeah.

264
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:28,072
The Heathkit's at school.

265
00:17:28,156 --> 00:17:32,410
There is no way we're gonna get the weirdo
in there without anyone noticing.

266
00:17:32,493 --> 00:17:35,371
I mean... look at her.

267
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,459
Wow.

268
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:23,586
- She looks...
- Pretty.

269
00:18:25,713 --> 00:18:27,006
Good.

270
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:28,382
You look pretty good.

271
00:18:44,649 --> 00:18:45,900
Pretty.

272
00:18:47,652 --> 00:18:48,861
Good.

273
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:34,740
Clear.

274
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:41,372
- You boys hear me all right in there?
- Loud and clear, Shepard.

275
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,166
Good luck in there, son.

276
00:20:44,602 --> 00:20:48,230
"The brown current ran swiftly
out of the heart of darkness,

277
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:50,316
bearing us down towards the sea

278
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:53,152
with twice the speed
of our upward progress.

279
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,906
And Kurtz's life
was running swiftly, too..."

280
00:20:57,531 --> 00:20:59,450
Nancy Wheeler?

281
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:01,410
If you'll come with me, please?

282
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,835
This argument
you and Barbara had?

283
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,545
What exactly was it about?

284
00:21:13,422 --> 00:21:15,758
It wasn't really an argument.

285
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:18,719
Barb just wanted to leave.

286
00:21:18,803 --> 00:21:20,930
I didn't, so, I...

287
00:21:22,723 --> 00:21:24,558
I told her to just go home.

288
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:26,769
Then what?

289
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:31,565
Then I went upstairs
to put on some dry clothes.

290
00:21:31,649 --> 00:21:34,527
And the next day, you went back and...

291
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,028
saw a bear, you're thinking?

292
00:21:37,321 --> 00:21:40,741
I don't know what it was, but...

293
00:21:40,825 --> 00:21:42,034
I think...

294
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,122
I think maybe it took Barb.

295
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:48,499
- You need to check behind Steve's house...
- We did.

296
00:21:48,582 --> 00:21:49,917
There's nothing there.

297
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,670
- There's no sign of a bear.
- And no car.

298
00:21:52,795 --> 00:21:53,921
- What?
- Look.

299
00:21:54,004 --> 00:21:56,257
We figure that Barbara
came back last night

300
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,467
and then she took off,
went somewhere else.

301
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:00,720
Has she ever talked to you
about running off?

302
00:22:00,803 --> 00:22:02,263
Leaving town, maybe?

303
00:22:02,346 --> 00:22:03,472
No.

304
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:05,766
No, Barb wouldn't do that, ever.

305
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:09,228
She wasn't maybe upset about the fact
that you were spending time with this boy?

306
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:11,522
Uh, Steve Harrington?

307
00:22:11,605 --> 00:22:13,232
What? No!

308
00:22:13,315 --> 00:22:16,485
Maybe she was jealous
because she saw you go up to Steve's room?

309
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:17,653
It wasn't like that.

310
00:22:17,737 --> 00:22:18,863
Like what?

311
00:22:18,946 --> 00:22:21,824
Steve and me, we're... we're just friends.

312
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,659
We... we just talked.

313
00:22:23,743 --> 00:22:27,788
Now was this before or after
you changed out of your clothes?

314
00:22:32,334 --> 00:22:34,753
So, Gary, tell me
about these troopers that brought in Will.

315
00:22:34,837 --> 00:22:37,047
It was about six of 'em, I'd say.

316
00:22:37,131 --> 00:22:38,382
They're all Staties?

317
00:22:38,466 --> 00:22:39,467
Yes, sir.

318
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:42,595
Never seen that many troopers
come with a body before.

319
00:22:42,678 --> 00:22:45,473
They told you that they were gonna
take care of the autopsy, huh?

320
00:22:45,556 --> 00:22:47,475
Yeah. Claimed jurisdiction.
Kicked me out.

321
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:50,561
Well, it all seemed a bit over the top
to me, considering...

322
00:22:50,644 --> 00:22:52,480
Considering what?

323
00:22:52,563 --> 00:22:55,691
Considering this was Will Byers
and not John F. Kennedy.

324
00:23:03,824 --> 00:23:06,327
- Thanks for stopping by, Gary.
- Sure thing.

325
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,954
<i>...let the people know that, uh,
the troopers are on duty</i>

326
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:12,583
<i>and you should be safe, because we think
this is just an isolated incident.</i>

327
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:15,169
<i>State trooper David O'Bannon,</i>
<i>thank you so much for your help.</i>

328
00:23:15,252 --> 00:23:16,837
<i>- Thank you, sir.</i>
<i>- Back to you...</i>

329
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,736
Okay, remember,
if anyone sees us, look sad.

330
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:42,488
<i>Attention students,</i>

331
00:23:42,571 --> 00:23:47,243
<i>there will be an assembly to honor
Will Byers in the gymnasium now.</i>

332
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:49,161
<i>Do not go to fourth period.</i>

333
00:23:49,245 --> 00:23:50,412
It's locked.

334
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:52,665
- What?
- Hey, do you think you can open it?

335
00:23:52,748 --> 00:23:54,458
With your powers?

336
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:56,001
Boys?

337
00:23:56,085 --> 00:23:57,086
Hey.

338
00:23:57,211 --> 00:23:58,671
Assembly's about to start.

339
00:23:58,754 --> 00:24:01,507
We know.
We're just, you know...

340
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,384
Upset.

341
00:24:03,467 --> 00:24:04,760
Yeah, definitely upset.

342
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:06,303
We need some alone time.

343
00:24:06,387 --> 00:24:08,556
- To cry.
- Yeah, listen...

344
00:24:08,639 --> 00:24:09,890
I get it. I do.

345
00:24:09,974 --> 00:24:12,977
I know how hard this is,
but let's just be there for Will, huh?

346
00:24:13,477 --> 00:24:14,478
And then...

347
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,483
the Heathkit is all yours
for the rest of the day.

348
00:24:19,567 --> 00:24:20,985
What do you say?

349
00:24:21,068 --> 00:24:23,571
I don't believe we've met.
What's your name?

350
00:24:25,614 --> 00:24:27,324
- Eleven...
- Eleanor! She's my, uh...

351
00:24:27,408 --> 00:24:28,492
- Cousin.
- Second cousin.

352
00:24:28,576 --> 00:24:30,786
She's here for Will's funeral.

353
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:33,122
Ah, well, welcome to Hawkins Middle,
Eleanor.

354
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,249
I wish you were here
under better circumstances.

355
00:24:35,332 --> 00:24:36,375
Thank you.

356
00:24:37,293 --> 00:24:39,044
Uh, where are you from exactly?

357
00:24:40,337 --> 00:24:41,505
Bad place...

358
00:24:41,589 --> 00:24:43,299
- Sweden!
- I have a lot of Swedish family.

359
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:44,800
- She hates it there.
- Cold!

360
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:47,469
Subzero.

361
00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:50,014
- Shall we?
- Yep!

362
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:52,808
<i>At times like these...</i>

363
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:56,729
it is important that we come together
as a community.

364
00:24:56,812 --> 00:24:59,023
We come...

365
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:03,527
Abort.

366
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:08,115
We come together to heal...

367
00:25:09,325 --> 00:25:10,743
we come together to grieve...

368
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,788
- You lied to the police!
- I didn't lie!

369
00:25:14,872 --> 00:25:17,124
How naive do you think I am?

370
00:25:17,207 --> 00:25:19,335
You and Steve were just talking?

371
00:25:19,418 --> 00:25:20,669
We slept together!

372
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:23,005
Is that what you want to know?
It doesn't matter!

373
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:26,425
- It does matter!
- No! It is all bullshit!

374
00:25:26,508 --> 00:25:28,719
It has nothing to do with Barb
and she's missing.

375
00:25:28,802 --> 00:25:30,679
And something terrible
happened to her. I know it.

376
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:32,681
I know it!

377
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:34,808
And no one is listening to me!

378
00:25:34,892 --> 00:25:36,435
Sweetie, sweetie, I'm listening.

379
00:25:36,518 --> 00:25:39,229
- I'm listening to you...
- No! You're not!

380
00:25:39,313 --> 00:25:41,315
Nancy... Nancy!

381
00:25:41,398 --> 00:25:43,108
Just leave me alone!

382
00:27:19,246 --> 00:27:20,748
Try him again.

383
00:27:21,582 --> 00:27:23,459
Shepard, come in.
Confirm comm.

384
00:27:25,127 --> 00:27:28,130
Shepard, come in.
Confirm comm.

385
00:27:30,007 --> 00:27:32,551
<i>This is Shepard.</i>
<i>Confirming, over.</i>

386
00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:35,429
Shepard.
Where are you?

387
00:27:35,512 --> 00:27:38,932
Can you describe to us
what it is you see? Over.

388
00:27:39,016 --> 00:27:41,393
<i>I...</i>
<i>I can't make out my location.</i>

389
00:27:41,477 --> 00:27:43,187
<i>It's hard to see.</i>

390
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,984
Shepard? Do you copy?

391
00:27:50,986 --> 00:27:53,238
Shepard?
Can you hear me?

392
00:27:53,322 --> 00:27:55,949
<i>There's something else...</i>
<i>There's something else in here!</i>

393
00:27:57,576 --> 00:27:59,828
Reel him in.

394
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:02,956
- Reel him back in!
- Get him in.

395
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,416
Come on, come on!
Faster!

396
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,001
<i>There's something else in here!</i>

397
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,128
<i>Pull me out!
Pull me out, pull me out!</i>

398
00:28:08,212 --> 00:28:10,422
<i>Pull me out! Pull me out!</i>

399
00:28:31,068 --> 00:28:33,987
- Shepard, come in. Over.
- Comms are down, sir.

400
00:28:34,071 --> 00:28:35,656
Shepard, come in!
Over.

401
00:29:06,061 --> 00:29:09,022
<i>Will Byers' death</i>
<i>is an unimaginable tragedy.</i>

402
00:29:09,857 --> 00:29:14,570
Will was an exceptional student
and a wonderful friend to all of us.

403
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:20,159
It's impossible to express the hole
his loss will leave in our community.

404
00:29:21,201 --> 00:29:23,537
I'd like to introduce you to Sandy Sloane.

405
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:26,290
She's a local grief counselor
from the church over in Jonesboro.

406
00:29:27,624 --> 00:29:29,001
But before she comes up here,

407
00:29:29,084 --> 00:29:33,255
I just want those of you who are having
trouble dealing with this tragic loss...

408
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:34,506
Look at these fakers.

409
00:29:35,424 --> 00:29:37,342
They probably didn't even know
his name till today.

410
00:29:37,426 --> 00:29:39,052
What?

411
00:29:39,136 --> 00:29:41,847
Who is interested in this?
This is so stupid.

412
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:44,391
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...

413
00:29:44,474 --> 00:29:46,643
Oh,
he was such a great student.

414
00:29:46,727 --> 00:29:51,023
Oh, he's going to leave
a hole in the community.

415
00:29:51,106 --> 00:29:52,691
Mouth breather.

416
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,876
Hey! Hey!

417
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:12,211
Hey, Troy!

418
00:30:12,294 --> 00:30:13,462
Hey, Troy!

419
00:30:15,672 --> 00:30:17,507
You... you think this is funny?

420
00:30:17,591 --> 00:30:19,009
What'd you say, Wheeler?

421
00:30:19,092 --> 00:30:21,637
I saw you guys
laughing over there.

422
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,847
And I think that's
a real messed up thing to do.

423
00:30:23,931 --> 00:30:25,974
Didn't you listen to the counselor,
Wheeler?

424
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:27,684
Grief shows itself in funny ways.

425
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:31,772
Besides, what's there to be
sad about, anyway?

426
00:30:31,855 --> 00:30:33,815
Will's in fairyland now, right?

427
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:36,860
Flying around
with all the other little fairies.

428
00:30:36,944 --> 00:30:38,445
All happy and gay!

429
00:30:52,334 --> 00:30:54,044
You're dead, Wheeler!

430
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:55,837
Dead!

431
00:31:06,014 --> 00:31:08,558
Dude, Troy peed himself.

432
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,402
Holy shit!

433
00:31:23,365 --> 00:31:24,992
Hey! What's going on here?

434
00:31:25,075 --> 00:31:26,159
Oh.

435
00:31:26,243 --> 00:31:28,328
Mike! Let's go!

436
00:31:36,378 --> 00:31:40,382
It's made of soft wood
with a crepe interior.

437
00:31:41,383 --> 00:31:44,886
Uh, now, I...
I don't know what your budget is,

438
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:48,640
but over here, we...
we have copper and bronze.

439
00:31:55,355 --> 00:31:57,357
Can you just give me a second?

440
00:31:57,441 --> 00:31:58,483
Of course.

441
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:04,531
Hey.

442
00:32:05,282 --> 00:32:06,325
Hey.

443
00:32:07,617 --> 00:32:10,871
Your mom, um... she said you'd be here.

444
00:32:13,415 --> 00:32:14,499
I just...

445
00:32:17,085 --> 00:32:19,046
Can we talk for a second?

446
00:32:21,214 --> 00:32:24,301
It looks like it could be
some kind of perspective distortion,

447
00:32:24,384 --> 00:32:26,428
but I wasn't using the wide angle.

448
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:29,056
I don't know.

449
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:30,349
It's weird.

450
00:32:33,393 --> 00:32:36,063
And you're sure you didn't see
anyone else out there?

451
00:32:36,146 --> 00:32:37,939
No.

452
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:40,484
And she was there one second
and then, um...

453
00:32:41,568 --> 00:32:43,111
gone.

454
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:44,821
I figured she bolted.

455
00:32:44,905 --> 00:32:47,240
The cops think that she ran away.

456
00:32:49,618 --> 00:32:51,244
But they don't know Barb.

457
00:32:51,328 --> 00:32:53,914
And I went back to Steve's...

458
00:32:55,123 --> 00:32:57,667
and I thought I...

459
00:32:57,751 --> 00:32:59,544
saw something.

460
00:32:59,628 --> 00:33:00,921
Some...

461
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,174
weird man or...

462
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,677
I don't know what it was.

463
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:14,059
I'm sorry.

464
00:33:14,142 --> 00:33:18,063
I... I shouldn't have come
here today. I'm...

465
00:33:18,772 --> 00:33:19,981
I'm so sorry.

466
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:21,441
What'd he look like?

467
00:33:24,111 --> 00:33:25,153
What?

468
00:33:25,237 --> 00:33:27,489
This man you saw in the woods.

469
00:33:28,281 --> 00:33:29,533
What'd he look like?

470
00:33:30,534 --> 00:33:33,537
I don't know.

471
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:38,333
It was almost like he...

472
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:39,459
he didn't have...

473
00:33:39,543 --> 00:33:41,378
Didn't have a face?

474
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,465
How did you know that?

475
00:33:59,813 --> 00:34:01,148
Aw, come on!

476
00:34:02,983 --> 00:34:04,568
Another, please.

477
00:34:04,651 --> 00:34:06,611
And another for my, uh, friend here.

478
00:34:07,821 --> 00:34:09,656
Oh, thanks, man.
Appreciate it.

479
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:12,325
Yeah, that's all right.
I'm, uh... I'm celebrating.

480
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:15,287
My daughter,
she won the spelling bee today.

481
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:17,622
Is that right?

482
00:34:17,706 --> 00:34:19,207
Yeah, that's right.

483
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:22,586
"Odontalgia."

484
00:34:23,503 --> 00:34:24,546
That was the word.

485
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,465
You know what it means?

486
00:34:26,548 --> 00:34:29,009
It's a fancy name for a toothache.

487
00:34:31,428 --> 00:34:34,973
Yeah, she's smart. She's real smart.
Don't know where she gets it from.

488
00:34:35,056 --> 00:34:37,350
I've been tryin'
to figure that out for years.

489
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:40,145
Your daughter, she got a name?

490
00:34:43,982 --> 00:34:45,025
What?

491
00:34:45,108 --> 00:34:47,652
Your daughter?
What's her name?

492
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:50,405
Sarah.

493
00:34:51,781 --> 00:34:52,908
Her name's Sarah.

494
00:34:55,368 --> 00:34:56,411
To Sarah.

495
00:35:06,713 --> 00:35:08,590
I recognize you.

496
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:09,925
Are you famous or somethin'?

497
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:14,304
Uh, you might have seen me on TV, I, uh...
I found that Byers boy.

498
00:35:16,765 --> 00:35:18,475
So, you on that case or what?

499
00:35:18,558 --> 00:35:20,227
I just saw him on patrol, you know?

500
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,436
Dumb luck.

501
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:25,315
So that quarry, that's, uh...

502
00:35:25,398 --> 00:35:27,817
that's state-run,
where they found the boy, huh?

503
00:35:29,194 --> 00:35:30,237
Yeah.

504
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:36,618
Yeah, well, that's funny.

505
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:39,955
'Cause, you know, I know for a fact
that it's run by the Sattler Company.

506
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:43,875
Frank Sattler? Decent guy, still got
a couple operational quarries up in Roane.

507
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:45,335
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

508
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:47,462
That's right.

509
00:35:49,256 --> 00:35:50,715
So why are you lying to me, man?

510
00:35:53,927 --> 00:35:55,136
What's your problem, bud?

511
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,846
I don't have a problem.

512
00:35:57,764 --> 00:35:59,391
I'm just a concerned citizen.

513
00:35:59,474 --> 00:36:00,642
Yeah?

514
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:03,395
Well, stick your nose someplace else.

515
00:36:03,478 --> 00:36:04,771
The kid is dead.

516
00:36:04,854 --> 00:36:06,022
End of story.

517
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,986
Thanks for ruining the game, dick.

518
00:36:19,452 --> 00:36:20,537
Okay...

519
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,581
Let's try this one more time.

520
00:36:22,664 --> 00:36:24,666
Who told you to be out there?

521
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:26,501
What were you doing out there?

522
00:36:27,586 --> 00:36:30,005
I don't know!
I don't know. They...

523
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:34,342
they just told me to call it in
and not let anybody get too close.

524
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:36,052
Get close to what?

525
00:36:36,136 --> 00:36:37,387
The body.

526
00:36:39,014 --> 00:36:40,056
Who do you work for?

527
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,601
The NSA? Hawkins Lab?

528
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,520
Who is that?

529
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:47,480
- You're gonna get us both killed.
- Who is that?

530
00:36:47,564 --> 00:36:49,983
Hey! Hey!

531
00:37:08,918 --> 00:37:11,588
Come on!
Come on!

532
00:37:13,715 --> 00:37:15,425
Talk to me!

533
00:37:15,508 --> 00:37:17,802
I know you're here!

534
00:37:21,514 --> 00:37:22,682
Come on.

535
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:29,689
- Now what?
- She'll find him.

536
00:37:29,773 --> 00:37:30,899
Right, El?

537
00:37:42,702 --> 00:37:44,037
Eleven?

538
00:37:46,122 --> 00:37:47,666
Are you listening?

539
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,545
That man before you...

540
00:37:56,383 --> 00:37:58,301
I need you to find him.

541
00:38:03,556 --> 00:38:06,059
- Hurt him?
- No.

542
00:38:06,142 --> 00:38:08,728
No, I don't want you to hurt him.

543
00:38:10,313 --> 00:38:12,357
I want you to listen to him.

544
00:38:16,111 --> 00:38:17,737
- Listen?
- Yes.

545
00:38:18,738 --> 00:38:23,243
I want you to listen to what he says
and repeat his words back to me.

546
00:38:24,577 --> 00:38:27,831
Just like we used to
with those old nursery rhymes.

547
00:38:27,914 --> 00:38:29,332
Do you remember?

548
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:32,085
Hmm?

549
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:34,295
Do you think you can do that for me?

550
00:38:36,256 --> 00:38:38,049
- Mmm-hmm.
- Good.

551
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,985
<i>Begin.</i>

552
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:58,903
Amulet.

Frigid.

Evolve.

555
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:04,951
Airplane.

556
00:39:05,952 --> 00:39:07,203
Eleven?

557
00:39:08,329 --> 00:39:09,956
Repeat the words.

558
00:39:15,003 --> 00:39:16,713

She's doing it.

565
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,310
- She's finding him!
- This is crazy.

566
00:39:30,393 --> 00:39:32,187
Calm down.
She just closed her eyes.

567
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,607
Holy...

568
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:44,741

<i>Hello? Mom?</i>

585
00:40:32,455 --> 00:40:33,498
Why can't he hear us?

00:40:33,581 --> 00:40:34,791
I don't know!

587
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:37,669

- El, are you okay?
- Oh!

00:41:44,527 --> 00:41:45,612
Can you move?

607
00:41:48,781 --> 00:41:50,033
Here, help her up.

00:42:32,742 --> 00:42:34,160

Enlarging.

Hmm.

612
00:42:40,667 --> 00:42:42,919
Did your mom say anything else?

613
00:42:43,002 --> 00:42:47,048
Like, um,
where it might have gone to, or...

614
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:50,551
No, just that it came out of the wall.

615
00:42:57,725 --> 00:42:58,935
How long does this take?

616
00:42:59,894 --> 00:43:01,104
Not long.

617
00:43:03,523 --> 00:43:05,984
Have you been...

618
00:43:06,067 --> 00:43:07,902
doing this a while?

619
00:43:07,986 --> 00:43:09,570
What?

620
00:43:09,654 --> 00:43:10,905
Photography?

621
00:43:12,573 --> 00:43:13,616
Yeah.

622
00:43:14,534 --> 00:43:18,705
I guess I'd rather observe
people than, you know...

623
00:43:19,622 --> 00:43:20,832
Talk to them.

624
00:43:20,915 --> 00:43:22,875
I know.
It's weird.

625
00:43:22,959 --> 00:43:23,960
No!

626
00:43:24,085 --> 00:43:26,170
No, it is.

627
00:43:26,254 --> 00:43:27,755
It's just, sometimes...

628
00:43:28,756 --> 00:43:31,467
people don't really say
what they're really thinking.

629
00:43:32,385 --> 00:43:34,303
But you capture the right moment...

630
00:43:35,221 --> 00:43:36,556
it says more.

631
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:38,016
What was I saying?

632
00:43:38,933 --> 00:43:40,643
What?

633
00:43:40,727 --> 00:43:42,020
When you took my picture.

634
00:43:43,771 --> 00:43:45,356
I shouldn't have taken that.

635
00:43:47,442 --> 00:43:48,568
I'm, uh...

636
00:43:48,651 --> 00:43:50,194
I'm sorry.

637
00:43:52,113 --> 00:43:53,573
It's just...

638
00:43:53,656 --> 00:43:55,199
That's it.

639
00:43:56,617 --> 00:43:58,244
That's what I saw.

640
00:44:01,122 --> 00:44:02,707
My mom...

641
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:04,751
I thought she was crazy

642
00:44:04,834 --> 00:44:06,586
'cause she said...

643
00:44:06,669 --> 00:44:09,422
that's not Will's body.
That he's alive.

644
00:44:09,505 --> 00:44:12,175
- And if he's alive...
- Then Barbara.

645
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:33,237
- Hey, Patty!
- Hey, uh, need something, Chief?

646
00:44:33,321 --> 00:44:35,823
- Oh, you know, I forgot my hat.
- Oh.

647
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:37,617
I'll just be a minute.

648
00:44:41,913 --> 00:44:45,792
Hey, I love that book.
It's a nasty mutt.

649
00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:46,918
Hey, you can't be back here.

650
00:44:47,001 --> 00:44:48,586
Yeah, I just got off the line
with O'Bannon.

651
00:44:48,669 --> 00:44:50,630
He said that he needs
to see you at the station.

652
00:44:50,713 --> 00:44:52,799
- It's some emergency...
- What the hell are you talking about?

653
00:44:52,882 --> 00:44:54,008
