00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,162


1
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,258
Hello?

2
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,430
Nancy?

3
00:00:32,224 --> 00:00:33,517
Nancy!

4
00:00:35,144 --> 00:00:36,353
Hello?

5
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,990
Oh, my God...

6
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,041
Nancy!

7
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:03,255
Hey, what's the matter?

8
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:06,341
Nothing.

9
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,496
You're so beautiful.

10
00:01:43,754 --> 00:01:45,255
Nancy!

11
00:02:40,267 --> 00:02:45,995


12
00:03:26,148 --> 00:03:27,399
Steve?

13
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:32,404
- Hey, Steve.
- Mmm.

14
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,158
I'll...

15
00:03:37,576 --> 00:03:39,202
see you tomorrow, okay?

16
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,331
Mmm-hmm.

17
00:04:16,698 --> 00:04:18,533
Oh! Jesus, you scared me.

18
00:04:18,617 --> 00:04:19,785
Oh, I scared you?

19
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:21,078
I know, I should have called.

20
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:22,746
Where have you been?

21
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,289
We agreed on 10:00.

22
00:04:24,373 --> 00:04:27,334
After the assembly, some people
wanted to get something to eat.

23
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:28,418
I didn't think it'd be a big deal.

24
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,671
You didn't think to call and let me know?

25
00:04:30,754 --> 00:04:32,422
With everything that's been going on?

26
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:35,258
I didn't realize how late it was, okay?

27
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,094
I'm sorry, Mom.
What more do you want?

28
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:38,470
Hey, wait...

29
00:04:38,553 --> 00:04:39,721
Whose sweatshirt is that?

30
00:04:41,473 --> 00:04:42,474
Steve's.

31
00:04:42,557 --> 00:04:44,267
Steve's.

32
00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:46,603
So is Steve your boyfriend now?

33
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:47,979
What?

34
00:04:48,063 --> 00:04:49,064
No!

35
00:04:49,147 --> 00:04:52,192
It was just cold,
so I borrowed his sweatshirt.

36
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:53,527
It's not a big deal.

37
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:55,779
Nancy?

38
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,447
What?

39
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:00,909
You can talk to me.

40
00:05:00,992 --> 00:05:03,870
You can talk to me.
Whatever happened.

41
00:05:03,954 --> 00:05:06,665
Nothing happened.

42
00:05:09,126 --> 00:05:10,669
Nancy.

43
00:05:12,587 --> 00:05:14,589
Nothing happened.

44
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,051
Can I please go?

45
00:05:42,951 --> 00:05:44,911
Will? Will?

46
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:48,665
Sweetheart, can you hear me?

47
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:49,749
Will...

48
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,084
Please...

49
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:52,794
Will...

50
00:05:54,838 --> 00:05:55,881
It's me.

51
00:05:56,798 --> 00:05:59,468
It's me. Just talk to me.
Talk to me.

52
00:05:59,551 --> 00:06:01,553
Just say...

53
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:03,805
- Mom?
- Jonathan!

54
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:06,766
- Come here. Come here.
- Mom, what is this?

55
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,394
Come here. Come here.

56
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:11,813
- What's going on?
- It's Will. It's Will, he's...

57
00:06:11,897 --> 00:06:13,732
he's trying to talk to me.

58
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:18,904
- He's trying to talk to you?
- Yes, through... through the lights.

59
00:06:18,987 --> 00:06:20,113
- Mom...
- I know.

60
00:06:20,197 --> 00:06:21,573
I know.

61
00:06:21,656 --> 00:06:23,783
Just... just watch.

62
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:27,454
Will... your brother's here.

63
00:06:28,914 --> 00:06:31,333
Can you show him what you showed me, baby?

64
00:06:33,668 --> 00:06:35,212
Please...
Did you see that?

65
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:37,255
It's the electricity, Mom.

66
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:38,590
- It's acting up.
- No.

67
00:06:38,673 --> 00:06:40,258
It's the same thing that fried the phone.

68
00:06:40,342 --> 00:06:42,886
No! It is not the electricity, Jonathan.

69
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:45,180
Something is going on here!

70
00:06:45,263 --> 00:06:47,891
- Yesterday, the wall...
- What? What about the wall?

71
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,143
- I don't know. I don't know.
- Mom, first the lights, then the wall?

72
00:06:50,227 --> 00:06:52,604
I just know that Will is here.

73
00:06:52,687 --> 00:06:54,189
No, Mom.

74
00:06:54,272 --> 00:06:56,942
- Maybe if I get more lamps...
- No, Mom.

75
00:06:57,025 --> 00:07:01,446
You don't need more lamps.
You need to stop this, okay?

76
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,698
He is just lost.

77
00:07:03,782 --> 00:07:07,869
People are looking for him,
and they're going to find him.

78
00:07:07,953 --> 00:07:09,538
Okay.

79
00:07:09,621 --> 00:07:11,832
- This isn't helping.
- Okay, okay.

80
00:07:11,915 --> 00:07:14,209
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

81
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,545
Can you do me a favor, Mom?

82
00:07:16,628 --> 00:07:18,380
Can you just try and get some sleep?

83
00:07:18,463 --> 00:07:21,132
- Yeah.
- Huh? Can you do that for me?

84
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:22,467
- I promise. I will.
- Yeah?

85
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:24,511
- Yeah.
- I just need to sit here for a minute.

86
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,472
All right, I'll go make breakfast.

87
00:07:27,556 --> 00:07:29,057
- Okay.
- Yeah?

88
00:07:39,442 --> 00:07:40,652
Will?

89
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:46,741
We just tell our parents
we have AV Club after school.

90
00:07:46,825 --> 00:07:49,411
That'll give us at least a few hours
for Operation Mirkwood.

91
00:07:50,453 --> 00:07:53,039
You seriously think that
the weirdo knows where Will is?

92
00:07:53,123 --> 00:07:54,833
- Just trust me on this, okay?
- Okay.

93
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,418
- Did you get the supplies?
- Yeah.

94
00:07:56,501 --> 00:07:59,129
Binoculars... from 'Nam.

95
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,381
Army knife... also from 'Nam.

96
00:08:01,464 --> 00:08:03,925
Hammer, camouflage bandana...

97
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:06,177
and the wrist rocket.

98
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:08,263
You're gonna take out the Demogorgon
with a slingshot?

99
00:08:08,346 --> 00:08:10,807
First of all, it's a wrist rocket.

100
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:13,226
And second of all,
the Demogorgon's not real.

101
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,311
It's made up.

102
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:17,647
But if there is something out there,
I'm gonna shoot it in the eye...

103
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,401
- and blind it.
- Dustin, what did you get?

104
00:08:25,322 --> 00:08:26,489
Well, alrighty.

105
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:27,824
So, we've got...

106
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:31,286
Nutty Bars, Bazooka, Pez, Smarties,

107
00:08:31,369 --> 00:08:33,914
Pringles, Nilla Wafers, apple,

108
00:08:33,997 --> 00:08:36,166
- banana, and trail mix.
- Seriously?

109
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,752
We need energy for our travels.
For stamina.

110
00:08:38,835 --> 00:08:40,962
And besides, why do we
even need weapons anyway?

111
00:08:41,046 --> 00:08:43,673
- We have her.
- She shut one door!

112
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:44,925
With her mind!

113
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:47,677
Are you kidding me?
That's insane!

114
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:50,639
Imagine all the other cool stuff
she could do.

115
00:08:50,722 --> 00:08:51,806
Like...

116
00:08:52,682 --> 00:08:56,353
I bet... that she could make this fly!

117
00:08:58,688 --> 00:09:00,065
Hey. Hey.

118
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:01,733
Okay, concentrate.
Okay?

119
00:09:03,735 --> 00:09:05,111
Okay, one more time.

120
00:09:06,321 --> 00:09:08,448
Okay.

121
00:09:08,531 --> 00:09:10,241
Use your powers, okay?

122
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,328
Idiot.

123
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:15,080
- She's not a dog!
- Boys!

124
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:16,915
Time for school!

125
00:09:19,084 --> 00:09:20,126
Just stay down here.

126
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,462
Don't make any noise,
and don't leave.

127
00:09:22,587 --> 00:09:25,006
If you get hungry,
eat Dustin's snacks, okay?

128
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,967
- Michael!
- Coming!

129
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,426
You know those power lines?

130
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,303
- Power lines?
- Yeah.

131
00:09:30,387 --> 00:09:31,429
The ones behind my house?

132
00:09:31,513 --> 00:09:32,722
Yes.

133
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:34,349
Meet us there, after school.

134
00:09:34,432 --> 00:09:36,101
After school?

135
00:09:36,184 --> 00:09:37,519
Yeah, 3:15.

136
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:40,730
Ah.

137
00:09:46,611 --> 00:09:49,406
When the numbers read three-one-five,
meet us there.

138
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,700
"Three-one-five."

139
00:09:51,783 --> 00:09:53,743
Three-one-five.

140
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,312
Hey!

141
00:10:21,396 --> 00:10:22,480
Hey!

142
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,066
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah!

143
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,609
Yeah, totally.

144
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,695
I just...

145
00:10:30,321 --> 00:10:33,116
I feel like everyone's... staring at me.

146
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:34,701
Oh, I didn't... I didn't tell anyone.

147
00:10:34,784 --> 00:10:36,036
I know.

148
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:37,954
I know.
Of course not.

149
00:10:38,663 --> 00:10:41,583
But what about, like, Tommy,
and Carol and them?

150
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:42,751
You're being paranoid.

151
00:10:43,752 --> 00:10:46,212
- I'm sorry.
- No. No, it's cute.

152
00:10:48,423 --> 00:10:49,424
Hey...

153
00:10:49,507 --> 00:10:51,176
I had a good time.

154
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:54,220
Yeah.

155
00:10:55,513 --> 00:10:57,015
Yeah.
Me, too.

156
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:10,987
Mmm.
Hmm.

157
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:29,464
Hey, Ally.
Where's Barb?

158
00:11:29,547 --> 00:11:31,382
Um, shouldn't you know?

159
00:11:31,466 --> 00:11:33,635
You haven't seen her anywhere...
at all?

160
00:11:39,349 --> 00:11:41,893
There she is.
Emerald City.

161
00:11:41,976 --> 00:11:44,103
I heard they make
space weapons in there.

162
00:11:44,187 --> 00:11:45,188
Space weapons?

163
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,398
Yeah. You know, like,
Reagan's Star Wars.

164
00:11:47,482 --> 00:11:50,151
I guess we're gonna blow
the Ruskies to smithereens.

165
00:11:51,486 --> 00:11:52,487
Hey, can I help you?

166
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,532
Uh, yeah.
We're here for a tour.

167
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:57,408
Oh, we don't give tours.

168
00:11:57,492 --> 00:11:59,536
Okay...
A quick look around.

169
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:02,247
You have to get clearance for that.
You can contact, uh...

170
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,915
Rick Schaeffer
at the Department of Energy.

171
00:12:03,998 --> 00:12:06,084
Maybe you seen it on TV.
We got a local kid that's missing.

172
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:08,002
We have reason to believe
he might have snuck in here.

173
00:12:08,086 --> 00:12:10,547
Like I said,
you have to speak to Mr. Schaeffer.

174
00:12:13,007 --> 00:12:14,843
- What's your name?
- Patrick.

175
00:12:14,926 --> 00:12:18,513
Patrick, I got a panicked mayor,
and I got reporters breathing down my neck

176
00:12:18,596 --> 00:12:20,181
and I got a very upset mother.

177
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:25,770
Now, I know the kid's not in there,
but I gotta check off this box.

178
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:30,066
Patrick, would you do me a favor?

179
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:33,695
Would you speak to your boss
and see what you can swing for us?

180
00:12:34,946 --> 00:12:36,281
I'd really appreciate it.

181
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,242
I'm talking ten minutes, tops.

182
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:52,398
<i>...was occupying a large part of Lebanon.</i>

183
00:13:52,482 --> 00:13:54,651
<i>Today, Syria has become a home for...</i>

184
00:13:57,195 --> 00:13:59,864
<i>I have the power!</i>

185
00:13:59,948 --> 00:14:01,574
<i>...gift that will last forever.</i>

186
00:14:01,658 --> 00:14:03,826
<i>From the Harmony Treasures' collection...</i>

187
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,273
- Joyce...
- Just ring me up, Donald.

188
00:16:39,357 --> 00:16:42,402
And you think this missing boy
may have crawled through there?

189
00:16:42,485 --> 00:16:45,113
Well, that was the idea.

190
00:16:45,196 --> 00:16:47,615
Yeah, I just don't see
how that'd be possible.

191
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:49,409
We've got over 100 cameras.

192
00:16:49,492 --> 00:16:52,120
Every square inch covered,
plus all my guys.

193
00:16:52,829 --> 00:16:54,288
No one breaks in here.

194
00:16:54,372 --> 00:16:55,998
Certainly not some kid.

195
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:58,501
Those cameras, you keep the tapes?

196
00:17:04,215 --> 00:17:06,467
If you don't mind me asking,
what do you guys do in here?

197
00:17:06,551 --> 00:17:08,302
You're asking the wrong guy.

198
00:17:08,386 --> 00:17:12,432
- Staying one step ahead of the Russians?
- I expect. Something like that.

199
00:17:12,515 --> 00:17:14,934
- Who's in charge here?
- That'd be Dr. Brenner.

200
00:17:15,017 --> 00:17:16,894
And he builds the space lasers?

201
00:17:16,978 --> 00:17:18,813
- Space lasers?
- Ignore him.

202
00:17:21,691 --> 00:17:23,901
This is the night of the 6th and 7th
we're seeing here?

203
00:17:23,985 --> 00:17:25,319
That's correct.

204
00:17:37,248 --> 00:17:38,458
Is that it?

205
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,461
Like I said, we would have seen him.

206
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:46,924
The night of the 7th,
we had a search party out for Will.

207
00:17:47,008 --> 00:17:48,718
You remember anything about that night?

208
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,053
Mmm, not much to remember.
Called it off.

209
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:53,723
- 'Cause of the storm.
- Yeah, a lot of rain that night.

210
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,475
You see any rain on that tape?

211
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,102
What are you thinking?

212
00:17:59,437 --> 00:18:00,730
I don't know.

213
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,941
But they're lying.

214
00:20:45,728 --> 00:20:48,230
That's why science doesn't
make any damn sense to me.

215
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:50,983
No, I swear. Look at this.
It's totally frostbite.

216
00:20:51,067 --> 00:20:54,278
Oh, thanks, man.
It's a heated pool.

217
00:20:54,362 --> 00:20:56,197
Well, if it's not frostbite,
then what is it?

218
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,115
Ugh, I don't care what it is,
it's disgusting!

219
00:20:58,199 --> 00:20:59,909
Get it off the table.
We're eating here.

220
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,285
Ew!

221
00:21:02,203 --> 00:21:03,996
Hey, Tommy.

222
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,956
When you left, did you see Barb?

223
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,459
- What?
- Barbara.

224
00:21:08,542 --> 00:21:10,002
She's not here today.

225
00:21:10,086 --> 00:21:13,214
I seriously have no idea
who you're talking about.

226
00:21:13,297 --> 00:21:15,466
Come on, don't be an ass, man.
Did you...

227
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:17,385
Did you see her leave last night or not?

228
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,097
No, she was gone when we left.

229
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,641
Probably couldn't stand
listening to all that moaning.

230
00:21:25,893 --> 00:21:27,561
Oh, Steve!

231
00:21:27,645 --> 00:21:31,065
- Oh, Steve! Oh, Steve!
- Oh, Steve...

232
00:21:31,148 --> 00:21:33,234
Oh, Steve!

233
00:21:33,317 --> 00:21:34,902
Okay, chill.

234
00:21:34,985 --> 00:21:38,906
Listen... I'm sure she's fine.
She's probably just...

235
00:21:38,989 --> 00:21:41,492
she's probably just, like,
skipping or something.

236
00:21:41,575 --> 00:21:42,993
Yeah.

237
00:21:43,077 --> 00:21:44,662
Yeah, probably.

238
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:04,974
- How about this one?
- Too big for the sling.

239
00:22:06,267 --> 00:22:09,311
So, do you think Eleven was born
with her powers, like the X-Men,

240
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:12,690
or do you think she acquired them, like...
like Green Lantern?

241
00:22:12,773 --> 00:22:15,901
She's not a superhero.
She's a weirdo.

242
00:22:15,985 --> 00:22:18,404
Why does that matter?
The X-Men are weirdos.

243
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:20,948
If you love her so much,
why don't you marry her?

244
00:22:21,031 --> 00:22:22,366
What are you talking about?

245
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,951
- Mike, seriously?
- What?

246
00:22:24,034 --> 00:22:26,078
You look at her all, like...

247
00:22:26,162 --> 00:22:28,622
"Hi, El! El! El! El!

248
00:22:28,706 --> 00:22:30,082
I love you so much!

249
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,001
- Would you marry me?"
- Shut up, Lucas.

250
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,586
Yeah, shut up, Lucas.

251
00:22:34,336 --> 00:22:36,422
What are you losers
doing back here?

252
00:22:36,505 --> 00:22:38,048
Probably looking for their missing friend.

253
00:22:38,132 --> 00:22:41,051
That's not funny.
It's serious. He's in danger.

254
00:22:41,135 --> 00:22:44,305
I hate to break it to you, Toothless,
but he's not in danger.

255
00:22:44,388 --> 00:22:46,765
He's dead.
That's what my dad says.

256
00:22:46,849 --> 00:22:49,143
He said he was probably killed
by some other queer.

257
00:22:50,561 --> 00:22:52,313
Come on.
Just ignore them.

258
00:22:57,067 --> 00:22:59,195
Watch where you're going, Frogface.

259
00:23:00,738 --> 00:23:02,531
- You all right?
- Yeah.

260
00:23:08,162 --> 00:23:09,830
Hey.

261
00:23:09,914 --> 00:23:11,415
How about this one?

262
00:23:12,249 --> 00:23:15,002
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

263
00:23:15,085 --> 00:23:16,504
Yeah, this is it.

264
00:23:16,587 --> 00:23:18,506
Oh, yeah.

265
00:23:18,589 --> 00:23:20,966
Yeah, this is the monster killer!

266
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,092
Whoo!

267
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:49,328
Hey.

268
00:23:50,538 --> 00:23:52,039
Oh, hey.

269
00:24:33,247 --> 00:24:35,165
- Hey!
- Hey, Karen.

270
00:24:35,249 --> 00:24:36,250
Hi...

271
00:24:38,836 --> 00:24:39,878
I brought you a casserole.

272
00:24:41,088 --> 00:24:43,090
Oh! Thank you, uh...

273
00:24:44,133 --> 00:24:46,719
Uh, you wanna... come in?

274
00:25:02,943 --> 00:25:06,071
Hey, Marissa.
How you doin'?

275
00:25:07,531 --> 00:25:09,533
You have a lot of nerve showing up here.

276
00:25:09,617 --> 00:25:10,951
What?

277
00:25:11,035 --> 00:25:13,037
You could have at least called, said,

278
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,583
"Marissa! Hey, it's not gonna work out.
Sorry I wasted your time. I'm a dick."

279
00:25:19,043 --> 00:25:20,169
Yep.

280
00:25:22,838 --> 00:25:25,215
I'm sorry. Uh...

281
00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:27,676
Maybe we could go out again next week?

282
00:25:32,806 --> 00:25:35,309
Newspapers?
You guys got newspapers around here?

283
00:25:35,976 --> 00:25:38,812
We have the <i>New York Times,</i>
the <i>Post,</i> all the big ones.

284
00:25:38,896 --> 00:25:40,439
Organized by year and topic.

285
00:25:40,522 --> 00:25:43,233
You can find the corresponding microfiche
in the reading room.

286
00:25:43,317 --> 00:25:46,111
Okay, we're looking for anything
on the Hawkins National Laboratory.

287
00:25:46,195 --> 00:25:47,946
Well, shouldn't you be looking
for that missing kid?

288
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:50,199
Yeah. We are.

289
00:25:51,367 --> 00:25:53,243
Uh, so, why don't you start
with the <i>Times,</i>

290
00:25:53,327 --> 00:25:54,745
and we'll check out the <i>Post.</i>

291
00:26:03,712 --> 00:26:05,297
The librarian?

292
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:52,803
Will always loved
Christmas, you know.

293
00:26:52,886 --> 00:26:55,180
So I thought if I...
I put the lights up...

294
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:57,850
I don't know, he...

295
00:26:57,933 --> 00:26:59,601
I'd feel like he was home somehow.

296
00:26:59,685 --> 00:27:01,186
It's silly, I know.

297
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:04,314
No.
No, it's not silly.

298
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:06,400
How is Jonathan holding up?

299
00:27:06,483 --> 00:27:09,445
You know,
he's good at taking care of himself.

300
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:11,488
He always has been, you know?

301
00:27:11,572 --> 00:27:12,823
I...

302
00:27:12,906 --> 00:27:16,076
I mean,
he thinks I'm losing my mind, but...

303
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,705
Is something the matter?

304
00:27:19,788 --> 00:27:21,123
Uh, no.

305
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:22,458
No, I just...

306
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:24,752
We're having electrical problems.

307
00:27:24,835 --> 00:27:25,961
Joyce.

308
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:28,464
I want you to know something.

309
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:31,675
If you need anything, anything at all...

310
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:33,302
Ted and I are here for you.

311
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,429
Thank you.
Thanks.

312
00:27:35,512 --> 00:27:36,805
Okay.

313
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,641
How... how's Mike
dealing with this?

314
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:41,518
Is he, uh, okay?

315
00:27:41,602 --> 00:27:44,563
Mike?
Uh... I don't know.

316
00:27:44,646 --> 00:27:46,190
He skipped school yesterday.

317
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:49,234
He's never done anything like that before.

318
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,859
Let me throw in that casserole, okay?

319
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:35,030
Oh, where's Holly?

320
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,336
Hey!

321
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,088
She shouldn't be here.

322
00:28:51,171 --> 00:28:54,675
Oh, I'm sorry.
She's quite the explorer these days.

323
00:28:55,717 --> 00:28:58,011
- Wait, did you see something?
- Yeah.

324
00:28:58,095 --> 00:28:59,763
What did... what did you see?
Tell me.

325
00:28:59,847 --> 00:29:01,723
- What did you see? What...
- Joyce... Joyce!

326
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:05,686
Listen... Karen,
thank you for the casserole,

327
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:07,020
but I need you to leave.

328
00:29:07,688 --> 00:29:08,814
Okay?

329
00:29:10,065 --> 00:29:12,401
Come on, come on, come on...

330
00:29:14,194 --> 00:29:16,446
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi.

331
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,407
Hi, uh, Ms. Holland, it's Nancy.

332
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,867
Oh, Nancy, how are you?

333
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:20,993
<i>Good.
I'm good.</i>

334
00:29:21,076 --> 00:29:24,288
Um, I was just wondering, uh,
is Barb there?

335
00:29:24,371 --> 00:29:26,331
<i>Mmm... No, she hasn't come home yet.</i>

336
00:29:27,416 --> 00:29:29,793
But she did come home, right?
After the vigil?

337
00:29:29,877 --> 00:29:33,130
No, she said she was staying
with you last night.

338
00:29:33,213 --> 00:29:37,009
Right, yes.
She did, sorry.

339
00:29:37,092 --> 00:29:40,262
I meant, did she come home this morning?

340
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:43,515
I think she left some textbooks
and she was gonna go pick them up.

341
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:45,809
Oh, um, no, I haven't seen her.

342
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:50,814
Do... Do you know what?
I just remembered... she's at the library.

343
00:29:50,898 --> 00:29:54,526
Nancy, will you please have her call me
as soon as you find her?

344
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,570
Yeah.
Yeah, I will.

345
00:29:57,779 --> 00:29:58,989
Sorry to bother you.

346
00:30:12,336 --> 00:30:14,046
Hey, man.

347
00:30:14,129 --> 00:30:15,172
What's going on?

348
00:30:15,255 --> 00:30:17,257
Nicole here was, uh,
telling us about your work.

349
00:30:17,341 --> 00:30:19,635
- We've heard great things.
- Yeah, sounds cool.

350
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:23,430
And we'd just love to take a look.
You know, as... connoisseurs of art.

351
00:30:23,513 --> 00:30:25,474
I don't know
what you're talking about.

352
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:26,767
- Oh, no? Oh...
- Hey.

353
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:29,061
Please, give me my bag.
No, just...

354
00:30:29,144 --> 00:30:31,605
Man, he is totally trembling.
He must really have something to hide.

355
00:30:31,688 --> 00:30:32,940
Here we go.

356
00:30:33,023 --> 00:30:34,733
Ah...

357
00:30:34,816 --> 00:30:35,817
Here we go.

358
00:30:37,361 --> 00:30:38,612
- Oh, man.
- Let me see.

359
00:30:40,447 --> 00:30:41,448
Dude.

360
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,451
Yeah, this isn't creepy at all.

361
00:30:44,534 --> 00:30:46,161
- I was looking for my brother.
- No.

362
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:48,997
No, this is called stalking.
Mmm-hmm.

363
00:30:49,623 --> 00:30:52,334
- What's going on?
- Here's the starring lady.

364
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:53,543
What?

365
00:30:53,627 --> 00:30:55,671
This creep was spying on us last night.

366
00:30:56,964 --> 00:30:59,007
He was probably gonna
save this one for later.

367
00:31:03,053 --> 00:31:07,557
See, you can tell
that he knows it was wrong, but...

368
00:31:07,641 --> 00:31:09,685
Man, that's the thing about perverts...

369
00:31:10,727 --> 00:31:11,728
It's hardwired into 'em.

370
00:31:11,812 --> 00:31:14,690
You know, they just can't help themselves.

371
00:31:16,817 --> 00:31:18,652
So...

372
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,446
we'll just have to take away his toy.

373
00:31:21,989 --> 00:31:23,657
- Steve...
- No, please, not the camera.

374
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,450
No, no, wait, wait...
Tommy, Tommy.

375
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,453
It's okay.

376
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,540
Here you go, man.

377
00:31:36,169 --> 00:31:38,422
Come on, let's go.
The game's about to start.

378
00:31:40,048 --> 00:31:41,133
Boo.

379
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:44,511
Bye.

380
00:31:59,192 --> 00:32:01,069
Hey, Nance!

381
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:02,404
Come on.

382
00:32:29,097 --> 00:32:30,265
Three-one-five.

383
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:32,934
Three-one-five.

384
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:34,227
Three-one-five.

385
00:33:41,294 --> 00:33:43,922
No! No!

386
00:33:44,005 --> 00:33:46,299
Papa! Papa!

387
00:33:46,383 --> 00:33:47,676
Papa!

388
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,845
Papa!

389
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:51,221
Papa!

390
00:33:54,891 --> 00:33:55,892
No!

391
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:48,403
Incredible.

392
00:35:42,332 --> 00:35:43,625
El!

393
00:35:45,585 --> 00:35:47,128
You okay?

394
00:35:49,548 --> 00:35:51,508
Hop on.
We only have a few hours.

395
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:04,980
So, I told Mr. Mundy...

396
00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:08,149
"The solution of ten plus Y equals...

397
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:09,609
blow me."

398
00:36:09,693 --> 00:36:12,028
Bull, if you did that,
you'd be in detention right now.

399
00:36:12,112 --> 00:36:13,572
Saturday.

400
00:36:13,655 --> 00:36:15,448
I bet Mr. Mundy's still a virgin.

401
00:36:15,532 --> 00:36:16,658
Oh, he's so a virgin!

402
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:19,661
Maybe you should blow him, Carol.
Help your grades a bit.

403
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,706
Whoa, Nance, where you going?

404
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:25,333
I totally forgot.

405
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:27,002
I told my mom I would, um...

406
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:28,545
I would do something with her.

407
00:36:28,628 --> 00:36:30,505
Well, what do you mean?
The game's about to start.

408
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:32,048
I'm sorry.

409
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:36,052
What the hell's wrong with her?

410
00:36:36,136 --> 00:36:39,097
Maybe she freaked out
when you went all psycho on the psycho.

411
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,181
Oh, give me a break.

412
00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:42,559
What'd you expect,
dating Miss Perfect?

413
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:50,567
Why did they hurt you?

414
00:36:51,735 --> 00:36:52,777
What?

415
00:36:55,238 --> 00:36:56,364
Oh, that.

416
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,449
Uh...

417
00:36:57,532 --> 00:36:59,200
I just fell at recess.

418
00:37:00,702 --> 00:37:02,329
- Mike...
- Yeah?

419
00:37:02,412 --> 00:37:03,872
Friends tell the truth.

420
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:09,919
I was tripped by this mouth breather,
Troy, okay?

421
00:37:10,003 --> 00:37:11,463
Mouth breather?

422
00:37:11,588 --> 00:37:13,465
Yeah, you know...

423
00:37:13,548 --> 00:37:14,674
a dumb person.

424
00:37:14,758 --> 00:37:15,925
A knucklehead.

425
00:37:16,009 --> 00:37:17,093
Knucklehead?

426
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,806
I don't know why I just didn't tell you.
Everyone at school knows.

427
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:24,726
I just didn't want you to think
I was such a wastoid, you know?

428
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:26,936
- Mike...
- Yeah?

429
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,521
I understand.

430
00:37:29,439 --> 00:37:30,857
Oh.

431
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,692
Okay, cool.

432
00:37:32,776 --> 00:37:33,985
Cool.

433
00:37:56,216 --> 00:37:57,384
Barb?

434
00:37:59,552 --> 00:38:00,887
Barb!

435
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,615
Barb?

436
00:38:31,251 --> 00:38:32,627
Barb?

437
00:38:50,103 --> 00:38:51,396
Barb?

438
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:54,399
Oh!

439
00:40:06,721 --> 00:40:09,474
Will... are you here?

440
00:40:13,102 --> 00:40:14,938
Okay, good, good, good, good.

441
00:40:15,855 --> 00:40:16,898
Are you...

442
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:21,027
Um, blink once for yes, twice for no.

443
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:23,571
Can you do that for me,
sweetie?

444
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:24,697
Can you do...

445
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:29,494
Oh, good boy.
Good boy.

446
00:40:30,495 --> 00:40:32,705
Baby, I need to know...

447
00:40:33,873 --> 00:40:36,334
Are you alive?

448
00:40:44,133 --> 00:40:45,593
Are you safe?

449
00:40:56,479 --> 00:41:00,024
I need to know where to find you, honey.
Where... where are you?

450
00:41:00,108 --> 00:41:03,570
Can you...
can you tell me where you are?

451
00:41:03,653 --> 00:41:04,988
Can you...

452
00:41:05,905 --> 00:41:09,659
Please, baby.
I need to find you. Tell me what to do.

453
00:41:11,953 --> 00:41:13,621
Please just...

454
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:18,042
Will...

455
00:41:44,777 --> 00:41:47,196
Hey! You're home early!
How was the game?

456
00:41:49,991 --> 00:41:52,619
Nancy?
What's the matter?

457
00:41:53,536 --> 00:41:54,787
It's Barb.

458
00:41:54,871 --> 00:41:56,080
I think...

459
00:41:57,498 --> 00:41:59,375
something happened.

460
00:41:59,459 --> 00:42:02,378
Something terrible.

461
00:42:04,505 --> 00:42:05,798
<i>I don't know, Chief.</i>

462
00:42:05,882 --> 00:42:07,133
What don't you know?

463
00:42:07,216 --> 00:42:10,386
This lady, Terry Ives,
sounds like a real nut to me.

464
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:14,515
Her kid was taken
for LSD mind control experiments?

465
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:15,683
She's been discredited.

466
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:16,851
Claim was thrown out...

467
00:42:16,935 --> 00:42:18,061
Okay, forget about her.

468
00:42:18,853 --> 00:42:20,396
Take a look at this.

469
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,690
- Dr. Martin Brenner.
- Who?

470
00:42:22,774 --> 00:42:24,400
Brenner.

471
00:42:24,484 --> 00:42:26,402
He runs Hawkins Lab.

472
00:42:26,486 --> 00:42:27,528
Okay.

473
00:42:28,863 --> 00:42:31,115
You don't find that interesting?

474
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:32,617
Not really.

475
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,578
He was involved in some hippie crap
back in the day, so what?

476
00:42:35,662 --> 00:42:39,832
No, this isn't hippie crap.
This is CIA-sanctioned research.

477
00:42:39,916 --> 00:42:42,043
Doesn't mean he had
anything to do with our kid.

478
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:45,129
Come on. Look at that.
Hospital gowns. All of 'em.

479
00:42:45,213 --> 00:42:47,423
Now, that piece of fabric
that the teacher found by the pipe.

480
00:42:47,507 --> 00:42:49,425
That sure looked
like a hospital gown to me, huh?

481
00:42:49,509 --> 00:42:51,928
- Am I wrong?
- I don't know, Chief.

482
00:42:52,011 --> 00:42:53,346
Come on, man.

483
00:42:53,429 --> 00:42:55,723
Work with me here.

484
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:58,393
I'm not saying that there's
some grand conspiracy.

485
00:42:58,476 --> 00:42:59,727
I'm just...

486
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:05,858
I'm saying maybe something happened.

487
00:43:06,943 --> 00:43:10,780
Maybe Will was in the wrong place
at the wrong time

488
00:43:10,863 --> 00:43:12,782
and he saw something
that he shouldn't have.

489
00:43:13,992 --> 00:43:16,536
- It's a reach.
- It's a start.

490
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:19,163
<i>Hey, Powell,</i>
<i>is the chief with you?</i>

491
00:43:19,914 --> 00:43:21,457
Hopper here.
What do you got?

492
00:44:05,001 --> 00:44:06,085
Here.

493
00:44:06,169 --> 00:44:08,713
Yeah, this is where Will lives.

494
00:44:09,255 --> 00:44:10,339
Hiding.

495
00:44:10,423 --> 00:44:13,051
No, no, this is where he lives.

496
00:44:13,134 --> 00:44:15,136
He's missing from here.
Understand?

497
00:44:18,264 --> 00:44:20,683
- What are we doing here?
- She said he's hiding here.

498
00:44:20,767 --> 00:44:22,477
Um... no!

499
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,229
I swear, if we walked
all the way out here for nothing...

500
00:44:25,313 --> 00:44:26,814
That's exactly what we did.

501
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:29,942
I told you she didn't know
what the hell she was talking about!

502
00:44:30,943 --> 00:44:32,737
Why did you bring us here?

503
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:36,032
- Mike, don't waste your time with her.
- What do you want to do then?

504
00:44:36,115 --> 00:44:37,700
Call the cops,
like we should have done yesterday.

505
00:44:37,784 --> 00:44:39,368
- We are not calling the cops!
- Hey, guys?

506
00:44:39,452 --> 00:44:41,662
- What other choice do we have?
- Guys!

507
00:44:50,213 --> 00:44:51,589
Will...

508
00:45:09,816 --> 00:45:10,900
Okay.

509
00:45:10,983 --> 00:45:13,319
Okay, baby, talk to me.

510
00:45:13,402 --> 00:45:15,112
Talk to me.
Where are you?

511
00:45:16,489 --> 00:45:18,783
"R." Good, good, good, good.

512
00:45:18,866 --> 00:45:20,243
That's good.
Come on, come on.

513
00:45:20,827 --> 00:45:22,078
"I...

514
00:45:22,787 --> 00:45:24,288
G...

515
00:45:24,372 --> 00:45:26,040
H... T...

516
00:45:26,749 --> 00:45:28,000
H...

517
00:45:28,084 --> 00:45:29,085
E...

518
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:31,212
R... E..."

519
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:32,880
"Right here."

520
00:45:33,881 --> 00:45:35,007
"Right here"?

521
00:45:35,091 --> 00:45:37,760
I don't know what that means.

522
00:45:37,844 --> 00:45:40,137
I need you to tell me what to do.

523
00:45:40,221 --> 00:45:41,222
What should I do?

524
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:44,559
How do I get to you? How do I find you?
What should I do?

525
00:46:51,876 --> 00:46:53,044
Oh, Jesus.

526
00:47:00,927 --> 00:47:03,304
Oh, God.
Please tell me it's not the kid.

527
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:34,251
It's not Will.
It can't be.

528
00:47:42,802 --> 00:47:45,388
It's Will.
It's really Will.

529
00:47:52,144 --> 00:47:53,312
Mike...

530
00:47:53,396 --> 00:47:55,564
"Mike"? "Mike," what?

531
00:47:55,648 --> 00:47:57,775
You were supposed to help us
find him alive.

532
00:47:57,858 --> 00:47:59,276
You said he was alive!

533
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,778
Why did you lie to us?

534
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:03,072
What's wrong with you?

535
00:48:03,155 --> 00:48:04,907
What is wrong with you?

536
00:48:05,574 --> 00:48:07,201
- Mike...
- What?

537
00:48:10,579 --> 00:48:13,124
Mike, come on.
Don't do this, man.

538
00:48:13,207 --> 00:48:14,250
Mike...

539
00:48:14,333 --> 00:48:17,003
Mike, where are you going?
Mike!

540
00:48:21,924 --> 00:48:23,175
Mike!

541
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:35,187
Mom?

542
00:48:36,897 --> 00:48:39,150
Mom, what happened?

543
00:48:39,233 --> 00:48:40,484
It's okay.

544
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:42,820
Hey.

545
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:49,410
Michael?

546
00:48:51,162 --> 00:48:52,371
What's wrong?
