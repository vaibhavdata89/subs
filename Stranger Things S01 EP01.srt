00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,162

1
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:48,050
Something is coming.
Something hungry for blood.

2
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:52,721
A shadow grows on the wall behind you,
swallowing you in darkness.

3
00:01:52,804 --> 00:01:54,765
- It is almost here.
- What is it?

4
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,183
What if it's the Demogorgon?

5
00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:59,311
Oh, Jesus, we're so screwed
if it's the Demogorgon.

6
00:01:59,394 --> 00:02:00,437
It's not the Demogorgon.

7
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:02,773
An army of troglodytes
charge into the chamber!

8
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,983
- Troglodytes?
- Told ya.

9
00:02:08,445 --> 00:02:09,863
Wait a minute.

10
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:12,491
Did you hear that?

11
00:02:12,574 --> 00:02:13,992
That... that sound?

12
00:02:14,076 --> 00:02:16,745
Boom... boom...

13
00:02:16,828 --> 00:02:18,580
Boom!

14
00:02:18,664 --> 00:02:20,541
That didn't come from the troglodytes.
No, that...

15
00:02:20,624 --> 00:02:22,292
That came from something else.

16
00:02:24,753 --> 00:02:26,755
The Demogorgon!

17
00:02:26,838 --> 00:02:28,298
- We're in deep shit.
- Will, your action!

18
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:29,675
- I don't know!
- Fireball him!

19
00:02:29,758 --> 00:02:31,051
I'd have to roll a 13 or higher!

20
00:02:31,134 --> 00:02:32,970
Too risky.
Cast a protection spell.

21
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:35,597
- Don't be a pussy. Fireball him!
- Cast Protection.

22
00:02:35,681 --> 00:02:38,392
The Demogorgon is tired
of your silly human bickering!

23
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:40,269
It stomps towards you.

24
00:02:40,352 --> 00:02:41,353
- Boom!
- Fireball him!

25
00:02:41,436 --> 00:02:43,730
- Another stomp, boom!
- Cast Protection.

26
00:02:43,814 --> 00:02:46,650
He roars in anger!

27
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,235
Fireball!

28
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:49,945
- Oh, shit!
- Where'd it go?

29
00:02:50,028 --> 00:02:51,738
- Where is it?
- I don't know!

30
00:02:51,822 --> 00:02:53,365
- Is it a 13?
- I don't know!

31
00:02:53,448 --> 00:02:54,616
- Where is it?
- Oh, my God!

32
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,285
- Mike!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

33
00:02:56,368 --> 00:02:57,452
- Mike!
- Can you find it yet?

34
00:02:57,536 --> 00:02:58,620
No, I can't find it!

35
00:02:58,704 --> 00:03:00,372
- Mike!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

36
00:03:00,455 --> 00:03:02,249
Mom, we're in the middle of a campaign!

37
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:04,459
You mean the end?
Fifteen after.

38
00:03:04,543 --> 00:03:07,713
- Oh, my God! Freaking idiot!
- Why do we have to go?

39
00:03:07,838 --> 00:03:10,507
- Mom, wait, just 20 more minutes!
- It's a school night, Michael.

40
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,051
I just put Holly to bed.
You can finish next weekend.

41
00:03:13,135 --> 00:03:14,678
- But that'll ruin the flow!
- Michael...

42
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,013
I'm serious, Mom.

43
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,557
The campaign took two weeks to plan.

44
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,559
How was I supposed to know
it was gonna take ten hours?

45
00:03:20,642 --> 00:03:22,519
You've been playing for ten hours?

46
00:03:23,854 --> 00:03:27,649
- Dad, don't you think that 20 more...
- I think you should listen to your mother.

47
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:31,194
Dang dumb piece of junk.

48
00:03:32,237 --> 00:03:34,197
Oh, I got it!

49
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:36,158
- Does the seven count?
- It was a seven?

50
00:03:36,825 --> 00:03:39,369
Did Mike see it?
Then it doesn't count.

51
00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:45,167
Yo, hey, guys.

52
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,127
- Does anyone want this?
- No.

53
00:03:50,589 --> 00:03:51,757
Yeah.

54
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:54,134
No, I don't think...

55
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,845
Yeah, he's cute.

56
00:03:56,928 --> 00:04:00,265
Barb, no, I don't think so.

57
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:01,808
- Barb, you're not...
- Hey, Nancy.

58
00:04:02,684 --> 00:04:04,061
There's a slice left if you want it.

59
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:06,480
- Sausage and pepperoni!
- Hold on.

60
00:04:13,362 --> 00:04:17,282
- There's something wrong with your sister.
- What are you talking about?

61
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:19,159
- She's got a stick up her butt.
- Yeah.

62
00:04:19,242 --> 00:04:21,745
It's because she's been dating
that douchebag, Steve Harrington.

63
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,580
Yeah,
she's turning into a real jerk.

64
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:24,998
She's always been a real jerk.

65
00:04:25,082 --> 00:04:26,958
Nuh-uh, she used to be cool.

66
00:04:27,042 --> 00:04:29,419
Like that time she dressed up as an elf
for our Elder tree campaign.

67
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:30,712
Four years ago!

68
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,255
- Just saying.
- Later.

69
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,884
- It was a seven.
- Huh?

70
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,719
The roll, it was a seven.

71
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:41,014
The Demogorgon, it got me.

72
00:04:42,391 --> 00:04:44,059
See you tomorrow.

73
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,744
- Good night, ladies.
- Kiss your mom 'night for me.

74
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,164
Race you back to my place?
Winner gets a comic.

75
00:05:06,248 --> 00:05:07,916
- Any comic?
- Yeah.

76
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:10,919
Hey! Hey!

77
00:05:11,002 --> 00:05:12,963
I didn't say "go"!

78
00:05:15,006 --> 00:05:17,050
Get back here!

79
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:19,261
I'm gonna kill you!

80
00:05:19,344 --> 00:05:21,763
I'll take your <i>X-Men 134!</i>

81
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,604
Son of a bitch.

82
00:06:28,663 --> 00:06:30,040
Mom?

83
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,667
Jonathan? Mom?

84
00:06:54,606 --> 00:06:57,317
Hello? Hello?

85
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:10,889

86
00:09:30,011 --> 00:09:32,305
<i>And that's it</i>

87
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:33,723

90
00:09:37,686 --> 00:09:38,770

91
00:09:38,853 --> 00:09:42,273
<i>we're getting reports of surges

92
00:09:42,357 --> 00:09:45,318

93
00:09:45,402 --> 00:09:47,779

95

<i>In other news,
you might wanna stay home tonight</i>

101
00:11:00,685 --> 00:11:01,978
<i>or at least pack an umbrella.</i>

102
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:04,481
<i>We turn to everybody's favorite
morning weather guy, Charles.</i>

103
00:11:08,985 --> 00:11:10,987
Where the hell are they?

104
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:13,490
- Jonathan?
- Check the couch!

105
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:14,699
Ugh, I did.

106
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:18,286
Oh... Got them.

107
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,748
Okay, sweetie, I will see you tonight.

108
00:11:21,831 --> 00:11:23,666
- Yeah, see you later.
- Where's Will?

109
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,834
Oh, I didn't get him up yet.

110
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:26,044
He's probably still sleeping.

111
00:11:26,127 --> 00:11:29,255
- Jonathan, you have to make sure he's up!
- Mom, I'm making breakfast.

112
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:31,174
I told you this a thousand times.

113
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:34,886
Will! Come on, honey.
It's time to get up.

114
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:41,643
- He came home last night, right?
- He's not in his room?

115
00:11:41,726 --> 00:11:44,020
- Did he come home or not?
- I don't know.

116
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,355
- You don't know?
- No.

117
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,482
I got home late.
I was working.

118
00:11:47,565 --> 00:11:48,608
You were working?

119
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:50,610
Eric asked if I could cover.
I said yeah.

120
00:11:50,693 --> 00:11:52,153
I just thought we could use
the extra cash.

121
00:11:52,237 --> 00:11:54,948
- Jonathan, we've talked about this.
- I know, I know.

122
00:11:55,031 --> 00:11:56,950
You can't take shifts when I'm working.

123
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:59,202
Mom, it's not a big deal.
Look, he was at the Wheelers' all day.

124
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,955
- I'm sure he just stayed over.
- I can't believe you.

125
00:12:02,038 --> 00:12:04,624
I can't believe you sometimes.

126
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:11,172
That's disgusting.

127
00:12:11,256 --> 00:12:13,466
- You're disgusting!
- Hello?

128
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,301
Hi, Karen.
It's Joyce.

129
00:12:15,385 --> 00:12:17,428
- Oh, Joyce, hi.
- What the hell, Mike?

130
00:12:17,512 --> 00:12:18,680
- Hey!
- Quiet!

131
00:12:18,763 --> 00:12:20,473
- Language.
- Are you kidding?

132
00:12:20,557 --> 00:12:21,933
Was that Will I heard back there?

133
00:12:22,016 --> 00:12:23,518
Will?
No, no, no, it's just Mike.

134
00:12:23,601 --> 00:12:25,019
Will didn't spend the night?

135
00:12:25,103 --> 00:12:27,522
<i>No, he left here</i>
<i>a little bit after 8:00.</i>

136
00:12:27,605 --> 00:12:28,940
Why? He's not home?

137
00:12:29,023 --> 00:12:32,861
Um, you know what? I think
he just left early for... for school.

138
00:12:32,944 --> 00:12:34,946
- Thank you so much. Bye.
<i>- Okay. Bye.</i>

139
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,804
That's weird.
I don't see him.

140
00:12:59,888 --> 00:13:01,431
I'm telling you, his mom's right.

141
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,349
He probably just
went to class early again.

142
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:05,935
Yeah, he's always paranoid
Gursky's gonna give him another pop quiz.

143
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,937
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen.

144
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:11,274
Step right up and get your tickets
for the freak show.

145
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,985
Who do you think would make more money
in a freak show?

146
00:13:15,737 --> 00:13:19,657
Midnight, Frogface, or Toothless?

147
00:13:23,411 --> 00:13:25,246
I'd go with Toothless.

148
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,791
I told you a million times,
my teeth are coming in.

149
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,627
It's called cleidocranial dysplasia.

150
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,712
"I told you a million times."

151
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:34,839
Do the arm thing.

152
00:13:35,632 --> 00:13:36,966
Do it, freak!

153
00:13:43,306 --> 00:13:45,558
God, it gets me every time.

154
00:13:46,851 --> 00:13:49,729
- Assholes.
- I think it's kinda cool.

155
00:13:49,812 --> 00:13:51,981
It's like you have superpowers
or something.

156
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,942
Like Mr. Fantastic.

157
00:13:54,025 --> 00:13:56,277
Yeah,
except I can't fight evil with it.

158
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,412
So, did he call?

159
00:14:06,496 --> 00:14:09,040
Keep your voice down.

160
00:14:09,123 --> 00:14:10,708
Did he?

161
00:14:10,792 --> 00:14:12,543
I told you, it's not like that.

162
00:14:13,127 --> 00:14:16,881
Okay, I mean, yes, he likes me,
but not like that.

163
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,883
We just...

164
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:21,511
made out a couple times.

165
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:24,973
"We just... made out a couple times."

166
00:14:25,056 --> 00:14:26,391
Nance, seriously,

167
00:14:26,474 --> 00:14:28,559
you're gonna be so cool now,
it's ridiculous.

168
00:14:28,643 --> 00:14:30,061
No, I'm not.

169
00:14:30,144 --> 00:14:33,815
You better still hang out with me,
that's all I'm saying.

170
00:14:33,898 --> 00:14:36,693
If you become friends with Tommy H.
or Carol...

171
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:38,069
Oh, that's gross!

172
00:14:38,152 --> 00:14:40,321
Okay,
I'm telling you, it was a one-time...

173
00:14:41,155 --> 00:14:43,241
Two-time thing.

174
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,372
You were saying?

175
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,259
- Steve...
- Mmm-hmm?

176
00:15:01,342 --> 00:15:03,011
- I have to go.
- In a minute.

177
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,764
Steve.
I really, like...

178
00:15:06,848 --> 00:15:08,683
Seriously, I have to go.

179
00:15:08,766 --> 00:15:10,143
Wait, wait, wait.
Let's...

180
00:15:10,226 --> 00:15:12,103
Come on, let's do something tonight, yeah?

181
00:15:12,186 --> 00:15:15,106
Uh... No, I can't.
I have to study for Kaminsky's test.

182
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:17,442
Oh, come on.
What's your GPA again? 3.999...

183
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:19,235
Kaminsky's tests are impossible.

184
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:21,487
- Well, then, just let me help.
- You failed chem.

185
00:15:21,571 --> 00:15:23,573
- C-minus.
- Well, in that case...

186
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,992
So I'll be over around, say, like, 8:00?

187
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:29,037
- Are you crazy? My mom would not...
- I'll climb through your window.

188
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,289
She won't even know I'm there.
I'm stealthy, like a ninja.

189
00:15:31,372 --> 00:15:32,623
You are crazy.

190
00:15:32,707 --> 00:15:34,542
Wait, wait, wait. Just...
Okay, forget about that.

191
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:35,918
We can just...

192
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:37,920
We can just, like, chill in my car.

193
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:40,965
We can find
a nice quiet place to park, and...

194
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:44,469
Steve... I have to study.

195
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:46,262
I'm not kidding.

196
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,639
Well, why do you think
I want it to be nice and quiet?

197
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,393
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.

198
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:00,943
Meet me at Dearborn and Maple at 8:00.

199
00:16:01,778 --> 00:16:03,154
To study.

200
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:17,668
Good of you to show.

201
00:16:17,752 --> 00:16:21,422
Oh, hey, morning, Flo.
Morning, everybody.

202
00:16:21,506 --> 00:16:25,176
- Hey, Chief.
- Damn! You look like hell, Chief.

203
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:26,260
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

204
00:16:26,344 --> 00:16:28,888
Well, I looked better than your wife
when I left her this morning.

205
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:31,599
While you were drinking or sleeping,

206
00:16:31,682 --> 00:16:34,644
or whatever it is you deemed
so necessary on Monday morning,

207
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:35,728
Phil Larson called.

208
00:16:35,812 --> 00:16:38,481
Said some kids are stealing
the gnomes out of his garden again.

209
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,024
Oh, those garden gnomes again.

210
00:16:40,108 --> 00:16:42,360
Well, I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna get right on that.

211
00:16:42,443 --> 00:16:43,986
On a more pressing matter,

212
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,114
Joyce Byers can't find her son
this morning.

213
00:16:46,197 --> 00:16:48,950
Mmm.
Okay, I'm gonna get on that.

214
00:16:49,033 --> 00:16:51,244
- Just give me a minute.
- Joyce is very upset.

215
00:16:51,327 --> 00:16:53,204
Well, Flo, Flo, we've discussed this.

216
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:55,623
Mornings are for coffee and contemplation.

217
00:16:55,706 --> 00:16:59,585
- Chief, she's already in your...
- Coffee and contemplation, Flo!

218
00:17:10,054 --> 00:17:12,849
I have been waiting here
over an hour, Hopper.

219
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:15,518
And I apologize again.

220
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:16,978
I'm going out of my mind!

221
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:20,648
Look, boy his age,
he's probably just playing hookie, okay?

222
00:17:20,731 --> 00:17:22,733
No, not my Will.
He's not like that.

223
00:17:22,817 --> 00:17:24,360
- He wouldn't do that.
- Well, you never know.

224
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:26,154
I mean, my mom thought
I was on the debate team,

225
00:17:26,237 --> 00:17:27,822
when really I was just screwing
Chrissy Carpenter

226
00:17:27,905 --> 00:17:29,574
in the back of my dad's Oldsmobile, so...

227
00:17:29,657 --> 00:17:32,618
Look, he's not like you, Hopper.
He's not like me.

228
00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:35,204
He's not like... most.

229
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:39,167
He has a couple of friends,
but, you know, the kids, they're mean.

230
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,085
They make fun of him.
They call him names.

231
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:43,212
- They laugh at him, his clothes...
- His clothes?

232
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:45,256
- What's wrong with his clothes?
- I don't know.

233
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:47,633
- Does that matter?
- Maybe.

234
00:17:47,717 --> 00:17:50,761
Look, he's...
He's a sensitive kid.

235
00:17:50,845 --> 00:17:54,557
Lonnie...
Lonnie used to say he was queer.

236
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,975
Called him a fag.

237
00:17:56,058 --> 00:17:59,979
- Is he?
- He's missing is what he is.

238
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,858
When was the last time
you heard from Lonnie?

239
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:10,323
Uh, last I heard, he was in Indianapolis.
That was about a year ago.

240
00:18:10,406 --> 00:18:13,159
- But he has nothing to do with this.
- Why don't you give me his number?

241
00:18:13,242 --> 00:18:15,119
You know, Hopper,
he has nothing to do with this. Trust me.

242
00:18:15,203 --> 00:18:18,414
Joyce, 99 out of 100 times,
kid goes missing,

243
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:20,625
the kid is with a parent or relative.

244
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,210
What about the other time?

245
00:18:22,293 --> 00:18:25,630
- What?
- You said, "99 out of 100."

246
00:18:25,755 --> 00:18:27,757
- What about the other time, the one?
- Joyce.

247
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,966
The one!

248
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,885
Joyce, this is Hawkins, okay?

249
00:18:30,968 --> 00:18:32,720
You wanna know the worst thing
that's ever happened here

250
00:18:32,803 --> 00:18:33,888
in the four years I've been working here?

251
00:18:33,971 --> 00:18:35,139
Do you wanna know the worst thing?

252
00:18:35,223 --> 00:18:38,351
It was when an owl attacked
Eleanor Gillespie's head

253
00:18:38,434 --> 00:18:40,144
because it thought
that her hair was a nest.

254
00:18:40,228 --> 00:18:42,897
Okay, fine.
I will call Lonnie.

255
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,690
He will talk to me before he talks to...

256
00:18:44,774 --> 00:18:46,734
- What, a pig?
- A cop!

257
00:18:47,818 --> 00:18:50,821
Just find my son, Hop.

258
00:18:50,905 --> 00:18:52,782
Find him!

259
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:05,545
Dr. Brenner.

260
00:19:07,505 --> 00:19:09,173
This way, gentlemen.

261
00:19:09,257 --> 00:19:12,093
The entire east wing
will be evacuated within the hour.

262
00:19:12,176 --> 00:19:16,013
We've sealed off this area
following quarantine protocol.

263
00:21:02,203 --> 00:21:04,830
- This is where it came from?
- Yes.

264
00:21:04,914 --> 00:21:05,915
And the girl?

265
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,669
She can't have gone far.

266
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,640
All right, and one more.

267
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:07,518
Hey, Ben.
What do you think about that, uh...

268
00:22:07,601 --> 00:22:09,145
Hey, I don't know.
I don't know.

269
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:11,564
I don't know,
37 points per game average...

270
00:22:11,647 --> 00:22:13,357
- Thirty-seven now, but...
- Mr. Basket.

271
00:22:43,512 --> 00:22:45,014
Hey!

272
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:46,223
Come here!

273
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:48,267
Hey, come here!

274
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,982
You think you can steal from me, boy?

275
00:22:57,485 --> 00:22:58,652
What in the hell?

276
00:23:00,196 --> 00:23:03,032
Remember, finish chapter 12

277
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:06,911
and answer 12.3 on the difference
between an experiment

278
00:23:06,994 --> 00:23:09,121
and other forms of science investigation.

279
00:23:09,205 --> 00:23:13,083
This will be on the test,
which will cover chapters 10 through 12.

280
00:23:13,167 --> 00:23:16,212
It will be multiple choice
with an essay section.

281
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,256
So, did it come?

282
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,716
Sorry, boys.

283
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,676
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
but...

284
00:23:23,886 --> 00:23:24,803
it came.

285
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,391
Yes!

286
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:31,268
The Heathkit ham shack.

287
00:23:31,352 --> 00:23:32,811
- Whoa.
- Ain't she a beaut?

288
00:23:32,895 --> 00:23:34,939
I bet you can talk to New York
on this thing.

289
00:23:35,022 --> 00:23:36,190
Think bigger.

290
00:23:36,273 --> 00:23:38,275
- California?
- Bigger.

291
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:39,735
Australia?

292
00:23:40,694 --> 00:23:42,279
Oh, man!

293
00:23:42,363 --> 00:23:45,241
When Will sees this,
he's totally gonna blow his shit.

294
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:46,408
Lucas!

295
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:47,868
Sorry.

296
00:23:50,412 --> 00:23:52,831
Hello, this is Mike Wheeler,

297
00:23:52,915 --> 00:23:55,626
president of Hawkins Middle AV Club.

298
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:58,379
What are you doing?

299
00:23:58,462 --> 00:23:59,630
Hello, this is Dustin,

300
00:23:59,713 --> 00:24:02,716
and this is the secretary and treasurer
of Hawkins Middle AV Club.

301
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,969
Do you eat kangaroos for breakfast?

302
00:24:07,137 --> 00:24:11,976
Sorry to interrupt, but, uh, may I borrow
Michael, Lucas and Dustin?

303
00:24:16,981 --> 00:24:18,524
Okay, okay, okay.

304
00:24:18,607 --> 00:24:21,569
One at a time, all right?
You.

305
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,280
- You said he takes what?
- Mirkwood.

306
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:26,949
- Mirkwood?
- Yeah.

307
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:30,536
- Have you ever heard of Mirkwood?
- I have not. That sounds made up to me.

308
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:32,413
No, it's from <i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

309
00:24:32,496 --> 00:24:35,374
- Well, <i>The Hobbit.</i>
- It doesn't matter.

310
00:24:35,457 --> 00:24:37,293
- He asked!
- "He asked!"

311
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,961
- Shut up, guys!
- Hey, hey, hey!

312
00:24:39,086 --> 00:24:41,005
- What'd I just say?
- Shut up.

313
00:24:41,088 --> 00:24:44,383
One at a damn time.
You.

314
00:24:44,466 --> 00:24:47,678
Mirkwood, it's a real road.
It's just the name that's made up.

315
00:24:47,761 --> 00:24:49,138
It's where Cornwallis and Kerley meet.

316
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,724
- Yeah, all right, I think I know that...
- We can show you, if you want.

317
00:24:51,807 --> 00:24:53,142
I said that I know it!

318
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:55,144
- We can help look.
- Yeah.

319
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,146
No.

320
00:24:57,229 --> 00:25:00,357
No.
After school, you are all to go home.

321
00:25:00,441 --> 00:25:01,650
Immediately.

322
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:05,529
That means no biking around looking
for your friend, no investigating,

323
00:25:05,613 --> 00:25:06,697
no nonsense.

324
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,741
This isn't some <i>Lord of the Rings</i> book.

325
00:25:08,824 --> 00:25:11,619
<i>- The Hobbit.</i>
- Shut up!

326
00:25:11,702 --> 00:25:13,078
- Hey!
- Stop it!

327
00:25:14,371 --> 00:25:16,290
Do I make myself clear?

328
00:25:21,503 --> 00:25:26,050
Do I make myself... clear?

329
00:25:27,051 --> 00:25:28,844
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

330
00:25:40,689 --> 00:25:42,399
Ring-a-ding-ding!

331
00:25:42,483 --> 00:25:44,193
Anybody home?

332
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:45,903
Password?

333
00:25:45,986 --> 00:25:47,946
Uh, Rada...

334
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:51,784
Radaga... Radagast?

335
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:54,286
Yeah. You may enter.

336
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,830
Thank you, sir.

337
00:25:57,831 --> 00:25:59,458
So, guess what?

338
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:02,002
I got off early and...

339
00:26:02,086 --> 00:26:04,755
Ta-da!
<i>Poltergeist.</i>

340
00:26:04,838 --> 00:26:06,382
I... I thought I wasn't allowed to see it.

341
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:07,841
I changed my mind.

342
00:26:08,884 --> 00:26:10,719
As long as you don't have nightmares
for a week.

343
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:13,305
No, I won't.
I don't get scared like that anymore.

344
00:26:13,389 --> 00:26:14,390
Oh, yeah?

345
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:16,141
Not even of clowns?

346
00:26:16,225 --> 00:26:17,309
No.

347
00:26:17,393 --> 00:26:19,770
What about my witch?

348
00:26:19,853 --> 00:26:21,271
- No. Mom...
- Ooh...

349
00:26:21,355 --> 00:26:23,190
- I'm not five anymore.
- But Will Byers...

350
00:26:23,273 --> 00:26:25,734
- I'm going to cook you up in my...
- Stop. That's so stupid. Mom!

351
00:26:30,072 --> 00:26:31,198
Will?

352
00:26:31,281 --> 00:26:32,866
- Will?
- Will?

353
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:35,661
Will?

354
00:26:38,622 --> 00:26:40,207
- Will?
- Will!

355
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:43,001
- Will!
- Will?

356
00:26:43,085 --> 00:26:44,628
Will!

357
00:26:44,712 --> 00:26:46,380
Where are you?

358
00:26:55,764 --> 00:26:56,974
Geez.

359
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,601
Your parents forget to feed you?

360
00:27:03,272 --> 00:27:05,107
Is that why you ran away?

361
00:27:08,569 --> 00:27:09,778
They, uh...

362
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:11,947
They hurt you?

363
00:27:14,825 --> 00:27:16,535
You went to the hospital, you got scared,

364
00:27:16,618 --> 00:27:18,287
you ran off, you wound up here,
is that it?

365
00:27:21,331 --> 00:27:22,541
All right.

366
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:27,755
I'll give this back, all right?
And you can have as much as you want.

367
00:27:28,422 --> 00:27:29,840
All right?
Maybe even some ice cream.

368
00:27:29,923 --> 00:27:32,009
But you gotta answer
a few of my questions first, all right?

369
00:27:33,469 --> 00:27:35,345
We got a deal?

370
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:40,976
All right, let's start
with the easy stuff. All right?

371
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:44,438
My name's Benny.
Benny Hammond.

372
00:27:44,521 --> 00:27:46,231
See? Like this. Here.

373
00:27:46,315 --> 00:27:49,234
I got you.
Don't worry. It's okay.

374
00:27:49,318 --> 00:27:52,780
Nice to meet you, yeah.
And you are?

375
00:28:02,122 --> 00:28:03,165
Eleven?

376
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:05,501
What's that mean?

377
00:28:06,376 --> 00:28:08,128
What's it mean?

378
00:28:09,213 --> 00:28:11,465
- No.
- Well, I'll be damned.

379
00:28:11,548 --> 00:28:13,258
She speaks.

380
00:28:13,342 --> 00:28:15,010
"No"? No, what?

381
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,807
All right.
I guess no more food, then.

382
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,058
Eleven.

383
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:23,477
Yeah.

384
00:28:24,812 --> 00:28:26,355
What's it mean?

385
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:29,525
Eleven.

386
00:28:31,235 --> 00:28:33,403
All right, then.

387
00:28:33,487 --> 00:28:35,239
Here you go.

388
00:28:35,322 --> 00:28:37,074
Take it easy, take it easy.

389
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:42,079
Yeah, look, all I know
is that she's scared to death.

390
00:28:42,162 --> 00:28:44,289
Yeah, I think
maybe she's been abused or...

391
00:28:44,373 --> 00:28:45,999
kidnapped or something.

392
00:28:47,501 --> 00:28:50,087
Yeah, it'd be great
if someone would come by.

393
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:54,633
Yeah, we're at 4819 Randolph Lane.
Yeah, Randolph.

394
00:29:21,535 --> 00:29:23,287
Will Byers?

395
00:29:26,081 --> 00:29:27,457
Will!

396
00:29:28,709 --> 00:29:30,961
Will Byers?

397
00:29:33,964 --> 00:29:35,966
Come on, kid!

398
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:37,301
Will?

399
00:29:38,427 --> 00:29:42,222
Hey! I got something.

400
00:29:49,271 --> 00:29:52,191
- That his bike?
- Yeah, he must have crashed.

401
00:29:53,483 --> 00:29:55,110
You think
he got hurt in the fall?

402
00:29:55,986 --> 00:29:57,529
Not so hurt he couldn't walk away.

403
00:29:57,613 --> 00:29:59,531
Bike like this is like
a Cadillac to these kids.

404
00:29:59,615 --> 00:30:01,241
He would've walked it home.

405
00:30:12,252 --> 00:30:13,212
<i>...get off work if I win.</i>

406
00:30:13,295 --> 00:30:14,963
<i>Oh, Friday I'm supposed to...</i>

407
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:17,841
<i>...but we will cover</i>
<i>whatever the damages are to your property.</i>

408
00:30:17,925 --> 00:30:19,593
<i>- It's just, um...</i>
<i>- That's for sure.</i>

409
00:30:28,936 --> 00:30:30,103
<i>Is Lonnie there?</i>

410
00:30:30,187 --> 00:30:32,481
<i>- Lonnie isn't here right now.</i>
<i>- Can you please...</i>

411
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:34,441
<i>- I told you, Lonnie's not here.</i>
- Who is this?

412
00:30:34,524 --> 00:30:36,526
<i>- His girlfriend, Cynthia.</i>
- Cynthia.

413
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:39,321
<i>- Who the hell is this?</i>
- Cynthia, this is Joyce.

414
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,156
<i>- Who?</i>
- Lonnie's ex-wife.

415
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,283
- I really need to speak to him...
<i>- Lonnie's not here.</i>

416
00:30:43,367 --> 00:30:45,244
- Can you please put... No!
<i>- Why don't you call back later?</i>

417
00:30:45,327 --> 00:30:46,536
No, not later. Now!

418
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,788
Can...

419
00:30:47,871 --> 00:30:49,289
- Bitch!
- Mom.

420
00:30:49,373 --> 00:30:51,833
- What?
- You have to stay calm.

421
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:01,635
<i>Hey, you've reached Lonnie.</i>

422
00:31:01,718 --> 00:31:03,929
<i>Leave a message
and I'll holler right back at ya.</i>

423
00:31:04,012 --> 00:31:07,766
Lonnie, some teenager just hung up on me.

424
00:31:07,849 --> 00:31:10,352
Will is... is missing.
I don't know where he is.

425
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:11,603
I need...

426
00:31:11,687 --> 00:31:14,273
I just need you to call me back,
please, just...

427
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:18,694
Damn it! Damn it!

428
00:31:18,777 --> 00:31:20,445
Mom?

429
00:31:20,529 --> 00:31:21,530
What?

430
00:31:23,573 --> 00:31:24,741
Cops.

431
00:31:39,589 --> 00:31:43,135
- It was just lying there?
- Yeah. Cal?

432
00:31:44,052 --> 00:31:47,723
- Did it have any blood on it, or...
- No, no, no, no, no...

433
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:49,308
Phil?

434
00:31:49,391 --> 00:31:51,810
If you found the bike out there,
why are you here?

435
00:31:52,853 --> 00:31:55,731
- Well, he had a key to the house, right?
- Yeah.

436
00:31:56,732 --> 00:31:58,150
So...

437
00:31:59,109 --> 00:32:00,277
maybe he came home.

438
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,404
You think I didn't check
my own house?

439
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,281
I'm not saying that.

440
00:32:05,198 --> 00:32:07,951
- Has this always been here?
- What? I don't know.

441
00:32:08,035 --> 00:32:10,871
Probably. I mean, I have two boys.
Look at this place.

442
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:13,665
You're not sure?

443
00:32:25,635 --> 00:32:26,636
Hey.

444
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,015
Hey, what's up with this guy, huh?

445
00:32:30,098 --> 00:32:32,601
Nothing, he's probably just hungry.
Come on.

446
00:33:51,555 --> 00:33:53,223
- Hey!
- Jesus!

447
00:33:53,306 --> 00:33:55,892
What are you, deaf?
I've been calling you.

448
00:33:55,976 --> 00:33:58,437
What's going on?

449
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:01,731
Hello?

450
00:34:01,815 --> 00:34:04,901
- Are you sure you're okay, Chief?
- Listen, I want you to call Flo.

451
00:34:04,985 --> 00:34:06,319
I want to get
a search party together, all right?

452
00:34:06,403 --> 00:34:09,531
All the volunteers she can muster.
Bring flashlights, too.

453
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,908
Hey, you think
we got a problem here?

454
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:21,710
We should be out there right now.
We should be helping look for him.

455
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:23,670
We've been over this, Mike.
The chief says...

456
00:34:23,753 --> 00:34:25,255
- I don't care what the chief said.
- Michael!

457
00:34:25,338 --> 00:34:27,007
We have to do something.
Will can be in danger.

458
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,300
More reason to stay put.

459
00:34:28,383 --> 00:34:30,427
- Mom!
- End of discussion.

460
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,560
So... me and Barbara are gonna
study at her house tonight.

461
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:41,062
- That's cool, right?
- No, not cool.

462
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:42,397
What? Why not?

463
00:34:42,481 --> 00:34:45,692
Why do you think?
Am I speaking Chinese in this house?

464
00:34:45,775 --> 00:34:48,820
Until we know Will is okay, no one leaves.

465
00:34:48,904 --> 00:34:50,697
- This is such bullshit.
- Language.

466
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,199
So we're under house arrest?

467
00:34:52,282 --> 00:34:54,201
Just because Mike's friend got lost
on the way home from...

468
00:34:54,284 --> 00:34:56,578
- Wait, this is Will's fault?
- Nancy, take that back.

469
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,205
- No!
- You're just pissed off

470
00:34:58,288 --> 00:35:00,248
'cause you wanna hang out with Steve.

471
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:03,126
- Steve?
- Who is Steve?

472
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:05,629
- Her new boyfriend.
- You are such a douchebag, Mike!

473
00:35:05,712 --> 00:35:07,506
Language!

474
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:10,592
Nancy, come back.

475
00:35:11,426 --> 00:35:12,677
Come back!

476
00:35:12,761 --> 00:35:16,181
It's okay. It's okay, Holly.
Here, have some juice, okay?

477
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:17,933
You see, Michael?

478
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:20,310
- You see what happens?
- What happens when what?

479
00:35:20,393 --> 00:35:23,980
I'm the only one acting normal here!
I'm the only one that cares about Will!

480
00:35:24,064 --> 00:35:26,107
That is really unfair, son.

481
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:27,400
We care.

482
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,074
- Mike!
- Let him go.

483
00:35:36,785 --> 00:35:39,204
I hope you're enjoying your chicken, Ted.

484
00:35:39,955 --> 00:35:41,498
What did I do?

485
00:35:43,833 --> 00:35:46,419
Hey! What'd I do?

486
00:35:49,464 --> 00:35:51,508
- Will!
- Will Byers!

487
00:35:51,591 --> 00:35:52,634
Will!

488
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:54,553
Will, we're here for you, bud!

489
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,641
He's a good student.

490
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:03,144
- What?
- Will. He's a good student.

491
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:04,854
Great one, actually.

492
00:36:05,355 --> 00:36:07,274
I don't think we've met.
Scott Clarke.

493
00:36:07,357 --> 00:36:10,652
Teacher, Hawkins Middle.
Earth and biology.

494
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:12,737
I always had
a distaste for science.

495
00:36:12,821 --> 00:36:14,781
Well, maybe you had
a bad teacher.

496
00:36:14,864 --> 00:36:17,200
Yeah, Ms. Ratliff
was a piece of work.

497
00:36:17,284 --> 00:36:19,911
Ratliff?
You bet.

498
00:36:19,995 --> 00:36:22,163
She's still kicking around,
believe it or not.

499
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:26,042
Oh, I believe it.
Mummies never die, so they tell me.

500
00:36:26,668 --> 00:36:28,169
Sarah, my daughter...

501
00:36:29,546 --> 00:36:33,717
Galaxies, the universe, whatnot...
She always understood all that stuff.

502
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,261
I always figured there was enough
going on down here,

503
00:36:36,344 --> 00:36:38,096
I never needed to look elsewhere.

504
00:36:38,638 --> 00:36:40,390
Your daughter,
what grade is she?

505
00:36:40,473 --> 00:36:43,268
- Maybe I'll get her in my class.
- No, she, uh...

506
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:45,895
She lives with her mom in the city.

507
00:36:45,979 --> 00:36:49,441
Thanks for coming out, Teach.
We really appreciate it.

508
00:36:51,651 --> 00:36:54,529
- She died a few years back.
- Sorry?

509
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:55,864
His kid.

510
00:37:08,335 --> 00:37:09,878
Lucas, do you copy?
It's Mike.

511
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:12,797
<i>- Lucas?</i>
- Hey, it's Lucas.

512
00:37:12,881 --> 00:37:13,882
I know it's you.

513
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:17,135
And say "over" when you're done talking
so I know when you're done. Over.

514
00:37:17,218 --> 00:37:18,845
I'm done. Over.

515
00:37:18,928 --> 00:37:21,348
I'm worried about Will. Over.

516
00:37:21,431 --> 00:37:23,475
Yeah.

517
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:27,228
This is crazy. Over.

518
00:37:27,312 --> 00:37:28,938
I was thinking...

519
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,276
Will could've cast Protection last night,
but he didn't.

520
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,361
He cast Fireball.

521
00:37:34,444 --> 00:37:38,198
<i>- Over.</i>
- What's your point? Over.

522
00:37:38,281 --> 00:37:42,994
My point is... he could've played it safe,
but he didn't.

523
00:37:43,078 --> 00:37:44,954
He put himself in danger
to help the party.

524
00:37:45,038 --> 00:37:46,164
<i>Over.</i>

525
00:37:48,958 --> 00:37:51,378
Meet me in ten.
Over and out.

526
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,201
What are you doing here?

527
00:38:23,284 --> 00:38:25,578
I told you on the phone,
I'm under house arrest now.

528
00:38:25,662 --> 00:38:28,498
- I figured we'd just study here.
- No. No way.

529
00:38:28,581 --> 00:38:30,834
Oh, come on.
I can't have you failing this test.

530
00:38:30,917 --> 00:38:32,711
So just... bear with me.

531
00:38:35,755 --> 00:38:36,756
What'd I tell you?

532
00:38:38,174 --> 00:38:39,300
Ninja.

533
00:38:53,356 --> 00:38:54,816
You like that ice cream, huh?

534
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:57,485
Smile looks good on you.

535
00:38:58,319 --> 00:38:59,904
You know, smile?

536
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:10,665
All right.
You just sit tight.

537
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:14,127
Whoever it is, I'll tell 'em to go away
real quick, all right?

538
00:39:16,337 --> 00:39:19,007
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

539
00:39:20,133 --> 00:39:22,635
- Hey, can I help you?
- Hi, you must be Benny Hammond.

540
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:24,971
I'm afraid I am. I'm afraid
we're closed for the evening, too.

541
00:39:25,054 --> 00:39:27,807
- So try back tomorrow morning.
- Connie Frazier. Social Services.

542
00:39:27,891 --> 00:39:30,769
Ah, Social Services. My apologies.
I didn't expect you so soon.

543
00:39:30,852 --> 00:39:33,688
- That's a heck of a drive.
- Not too bad this time of night.

544
00:39:33,772 --> 00:39:36,024
Hey, listen, I...
I haven't told her that you're coming yet.

545
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:40,069
I didn't want her running off again.
She's a tad skittish.

546
00:39:40,153 --> 00:39:42,781
- Children I work with usually are.
- Right, right.

547
00:39:43,364 --> 00:39:46,201
- So, where is she?
- Right. She's in the kitchen.

548
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:48,119
- Come on up. I'll introduce you.
- Thank you.

549
00:39:48,203 --> 00:39:49,996
Sorry again for trying
to turn you away there.

550
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,122
- It's fine.
- You know, it's funny.

551
00:39:51,206 --> 00:39:53,625
Your, uh, voice sounds different on the...

552
00:40:24,447 --> 00:40:27,367
Ah, man.
This is it.

553
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:37,961
Hey, guys.
You feel that?

554
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:42,674
- I think maybe we should go back.
- No.

555
00:40:42,757 --> 00:40:45,385
We're not going back.
Just stay close.

556
00:40:45,468 --> 00:40:46,594
Come on.

557
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:51,057
Just stay on channel six.
Don't do anything stupid.

558
00:40:55,728 --> 00:40:57,063
Hey, guys, wait up.

559
00:40:57,605 --> 00:40:59,023
Wait up!

560

"Which polymers occur naturally?"

Mmm.

Wow.
Jesus, how many of these did you make?

566
00:41:22,463 --> 00:41:24,299
You said you wanted to help.

567
00:41:25,341 --> 00:41:26,551
How about this? How about...

568
00:41:26,634 --> 00:41:28,177
How about every time
that you get something right,

00:41:31,514 --> 00:41:32,724
- Uh, pass.

572

- Come on.
- No.

573
00:41:33,933 --> 00:41:35,310

Yeah, that's not what you said.

No.

Steve, come on.

584
00:42:18,144 --> 00:42:19,145
What?

585
00:42:19,228 --> 00:42:21,356
Are you crazy?
My parents are here.

586
00:42:23,066 --> 00:42:25,568
That's weird, I... don't see them.

587
00:42:29,405 --> 00:42:34,077
Was this your plan all along?
To... to get in my room and then...

588
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,746
- get another notch on your belt.
- No. Nancy, no.

589
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:38,957
I'm not Laurie, or Amy, or Becky.

590

You mean, you're not a slut.

That's not what I'm saying.

You know, you're so cute when you lie.

593
00:42:44,879 --> 00:42:46,130
Shut up.

594
00:42:49,008 --> 00:42:50,385
Bad Steve.

595
00:42:50,468 --> 00:42:54,013
Bad.
Don't do that to Miss Nancy...

596
00:42:54,597 --> 00:42:56,641
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.

597
00:42:57,558 --> 00:42:59,602

there for you. I've been...

working so hard and I...

605
00:43:31,509 --> 00:43:33,344
I just feel bad.
I don't even...

606
00:43:33,428 --> 00:43:35,888
barely know what's going on with you.

607
00:43:35,972 --> 00:43:38,725
All right?
I am sorry about that.

608
00:43:42,103 --> 00:43:43,396
Hey, what is it?

609
00:43:44,313 --> 00:43:45,648
What is it, honey?

610
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,819
- Nothing.
- Tell me. Tell me.

611

- Come on. You can...
- No.

612

It's just...

613
00:43:54,407 --> 00:43:56,200
I should've been there for him.

614
00:43:56,284 --> 00:43:59,287
No. Oh, no.
You can't do that to yourself.

615
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:02,582
This was not your fault.
Do you hear me?

616
00:44:02,665 --> 00:44:06,335
He is... close. I know it. I...

617
00:44:07,003 --> 00:44:09,714
I feel it in my heart.

618
00:44:10,465 --> 00:44:13,259
You just have to...
You have to trust me on this, okay?

619
00:44:16,012 --> 00:44:17,680
- Yeah.
- Oh, look at this.

620
00:44:17,764 --> 00:44:20,141
Look at this one.
Look at this one.

621
00:44:22,477 --> 00:44:24,645
- I mean, that's it, right?
- Yeah.

Will?

629
00:44:45,041 --> 00:44:46,125
- Will?
- It's Will?

630
00:44:48,961 --> 00:44:50,338
Mom, it's Will?

631
00:44:51,339 --> 00:44:52,757
Who is this?

632
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,967
- What have you done to my boy?
- What? What?

633
00:44:55,051 --> 00:44:56,552
Give me back my son!

634
00:44:58,513 --> 00:45:00,348
Hello?

635
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:01,682
Hello, who is this?

636
00:45:01,766 --> 00:45:04,519
Hello? Who is this?

637
00:45:04,602 --> 00:45:07,063
Mom, who was it? Who was it, Mom?

638
00:45:07,146 --> 00:45:08,815
- It was him.
- Look at me, Mom. Was it Will?

639
00:45:08,898 --> 00:45:10,107
- Yes.
- What did he say?

640
00:45:10,191 --> 00:45:12,318
He just breathed.
He just breathed.

641
00:45:12,401 --> 00:45:14,362
- And was someone else there?
- I...

642
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:17,156
- Mom, who was there? Who was it?
- It was him.

643
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,951
I know it was his breathing.
I know it was his breathing.

644
00:45:21,244 --> 00:45:22,620
Will!

645
00:45:23,621 --> 00:45:26,123
- Will!
- Byers!

646
00:45:26,207 --> 00:45:28,960
I've got your <i>X-Men 134!</i>

647
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:31,796
Guys, I really think
we should turn back.

648
00:45:31,879 --> 00:45:33,130
Seriously, Dustin?

649
00:45:33,214 --> 00:45:35,508
You wanna be a baby,
then go home already!

650
00:45:35,591 --> 00:45:37,301
I'm just being realistic, Lucas!

651
00:45:37,385 --> 00:45:39,387
No, you're just being a big sissy!

652
00:45:40,012 --> 00:45:43,391
Did you ever think Will went
missing because he ran into something bad?

653
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:46,352
And we're going to the exact same spot
where he was last seen?

654
00:45:46,435 --> 00:45:49,272
- And we have no weapons or anything?
- Dustin, shut up.

655
00:45:49,355 --> 00:45:51,357
I'm just saying,
does that seem smart to you?

656
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,568
Shut up. Shut up.

657
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:55,319
Did you guys hear that?
