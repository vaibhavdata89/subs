00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,162

1
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:17,634
Let me out of here!

2
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,346
Somebody, please!

3
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,559
Let me out!

4
00:00:46,955 --> 00:00:48,373
Your son.

5
00:00:49,374 --> 00:00:51,668
We know you've been in contact with him.

6
00:00:53,962 --> 00:00:56,798
- You have to let me...
- When...

7
00:00:57,966 --> 00:01:00,510
and how did you make contact with him?

8
00:01:01,845 --> 00:01:03,305
- What?
- Hmm?

9
00:01:05,348 --> 00:01:06,599
Six.

10
00:01:07,684 --> 00:01:08,977
What?

11
00:01:10,395 --> 00:01:11,604
Six.

12
00:01:13,148 --> 00:01:15,900
Six people have been taken this week.

13
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,530
This... thing that took your son...

14
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,576
we don't really understand it.

15
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,162
But its behavior is predictable.

16
00:01:28,204 --> 00:01:31,332
Like all animals...

17
00:01:33,418 --> 00:01:34,669
it eats.

18
00:01:36,212 --> 00:01:37,922
It will take more sons.

19
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,008
More daughters.

20
00:01:41,384 --> 00:01:42,677
I want to save them.

21
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,222
I want to save your son.

22
00:01:47,724 --> 00:01:48,892
But I can't do that.

23
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,061
Not without your help.

24
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,354
Stop.

25
00:01:56,232 --> 00:01:58,026
I know who you are.

26
00:01:58,693 --> 00:02:00,570
I know what you've done.

27
00:02:01,863 --> 00:02:04,866
You took my boy away from me!

28
00:02:04,949 --> 00:02:08,703
You left him in that place to die!

29
00:02:08,787 --> 00:02:10,789
You faked his death!

30
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,000
We had a funeral.

31
00:02:14,084 --> 00:02:16,461
We buried him.

32
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:20,632
And now you're asking for my help?

33
00:02:24,761 --> 00:02:26,304
Go to hell.

34
00:02:31,935 --> 00:02:34,854
Okay, now what do you know?

35
00:02:34,938 --> 00:02:36,523
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:37,607 --> 00:02:38,608
Did I stutter?

37
00:02:40,235 --> 00:02:41,736
I told you.

38
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,196
Everything.

39
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,868
What do you know?

40
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,872
I know you do
experiments on kidnapped little kids,

41
00:02:52,956 --> 00:02:55,333
whose parents' brains
you've turned to mush.

42
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,009
And I know you went a
little too far this time

43
00:02:58,086 --> 00:03:00,004
and you messed up in a big way.

44
00:03:01,005 --> 00:03:04,134
I mean, you really messed
up, didn't you? Big time.

45
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,136
That's why you're
trying to cover your tracks.

46
00:03:07,345 --> 00:03:10,181
You killed Benny Hammond, you
faked Will Byers' death.

47
00:03:10,265 --> 00:03:12,684
You made it look like that
little girl just ran away.

48
00:03:12,767 --> 00:03:14,185
See, I told you.

49
00:03:15,436 --> 00:03:17,856
- I know everything.
- All right, who are you working with?

50
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,150
Nobody.

51
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,402
But I did give all this over
to my friend at the Times.

52
00:03:22,485 --> 00:03:24,195
He's gonna blow this
thing wide open.

53
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,664
You're just a junkie.

54
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:38,460
A small town cop who
had a really bad week.

55
00:03:38,543 --> 00:03:40,795
Took one too many pills this time.

56
00:03:44,507 --> 00:03:46,676
You made a mistake coming back here.

57
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,344
No, I didn't.

58
00:03:50,221 --> 00:03:51,681
Here's what's gonna happen.

59
00:03:53,391 --> 00:03:55,310
You're gonna let me
and Joyce Byers go...

60
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:58,605
you're gonna give us anything we need,

61
00:03:58,688 --> 00:04:00,732
and we're gonna find her son.

62
00:04:01,816 --> 00:04:05,528
And then we're gonna forget that
any of this ever happened.

63
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,739
Oh, is that right?

64
00:04:09,157 --> 00:04:10,325
Yeah.

65
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,495
That's right.

66
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:29,219
Nancy? Jonathan?

67
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,186
- They're gone.
- What?

68
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:39,630
Nancy and Jonathan. His car's gone.

69
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,189
They're probably just
sucking face somewhere.

70
00:04:41,272 --> 00:04:43,191
- Gross.
- No. No way!

71
00:04:43,274 --> 00:04:44,359
Did they go with the chief?

72
00:04:44,442 --> 00:04:45,443
I don't know.

73
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,153
No.

74
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:50,532
What? Did you see them? Do
you know where they went?

75
00:04:51,866 --> 00:04:53,826
- Yes.
- Where? Where did they go?

76
00:04:56,621 --> 00:04:57,956
Demogorgon.

77
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,607
Where's the girl?

78
00:06:55,198 --> 00:06:57,075
You gotta give me your word.

79
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,162
Nobody's ever gonna find out about this.

80
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:05,917
And those other three kids, those
boys, you're gonna leave them alone.

81
00:07:08,336 --> 00:07:10,046
Then I'll tell you.

82
00:07:12,507 --> 00:07:15,343
Tell you where your little
science experiment is.

83
00:07:40,451 --> 00:07:41,869
I don't understand.

84
00:07:41,953 --> 00:07:43,621
We came to an agreement.

85
00:07:43,705 --> 00:07:45,290
What?

86
00:07:45,373 --> 00:07:47,917
Look, everything that's happened
here and everything that's gonna happen,

87
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,418
we don't talk about.

88
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:50,712
You want Will back?

89
00:07:51,796 --> 00:07:53,423
This place had nothing to do with it.

90
00:07:54,465 --> 00:07:57,051
That's the deal. You got it?

91
00:08:06,436 --> 00:08:07,979
What is this?

92
00:08:08,062 --> 00:08:10,898
Protection. The atmosphere is toxic.

93
00:08:10,982 --> 00:08:13,359
But my son's in there. He...

94
00:08:13,443 --> 00:08:14,569
Put it on.

95
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,335
I'm telling
you, this is a mistake.

96
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:33,463
It's gone. Isn't
that what you wanted?

97
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,298
And if they find the boy?

98
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:36,966
That's not gonna happen.

99
00:10:14,112 --> 00:10:18,385


100
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:29,808
_

101
00:10:56,772 --> 00:10:58,149
Hey, you all right?

102
00:10:58,232 --> 00:10:59,275
Yeah.

103
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,039
I
need you to relax, okay?

104
00:11:01,944 --> 00:11:04,530
I want you to slow down your
breathing, take deep breaths.

105
00:11:04,614 --> 00:11:06,699
In and out.

106
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,493
Deep breath in...

107
00:11:10,494 --> 00:11:11,579
and out.

108
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:15,207
In and out.

109
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,545
- In and out.
- It's troll's favorite food!

110
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:21,349
- Princess!
- No, Daddy! No, Daddy!

111
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,716
Roasted princess with paprika and gravy!

112
00:11:23,742 --> 00:11:25,450
No! No, Daddy. No, Daddy.

113
00:11:27,845 --> 00:11:29,847
Whoa, hey!

114
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,265
Hey.

115
00:11:31,349 --> 00:11:32,725
You all right?

116
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:34,101
- What's going on?
- Whoa.

117
00:11:34,185 --> 00:11:36,585
- What happened? What happened?
- I don't know. I don't know.

118
00:11:37,313 --> 00:11:38,773
Hey, you all right?

119
00:11:38,856 --> 00:11:39,899
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

120
00:11:39,982 --> 00:11:41,984
Relax, relax. Honey, honey.

121
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,986
Honey, just breathe. Breathe,
breathe, breathe.

122
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,781
In and out. Slow, slow, slow.

123
00:11:48,532 --> 00:11:50,368
In and out with me.

124
00:11:50,451 --> 00:11:51,452
In...

125
00:11:53,204 --> 00:11:55,498
- You okay?
- Yeah.

126
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:56,707
Yeah.

127
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:18,479
Remember...

128
00:12:18,562 --> 00:12:21,315
- Straight into Will's room. And...
- Don't step on the trap.

129
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,817
Wait for the yo-yo to move.

130
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,360
Then...

131
00:12:26,195 --> 00:12:27,321
All right.

132
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:29,240
You ready?

133
00:12:30,991 --> 00:12:32,034
Ready.

134
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:35,246
On three.

135
00:12:36,205 --> 00:12:37,289
One...

136
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:39,959
two...

137
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,290
You don't have to do this...

138
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:43,295
Jonathan, stop talking.

139
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:45,260
- I'm just saying, you don't have to...
- Three.

140
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:48,259
Guys, guys! This is crazy.

141
00:12:48,342 --> 00:12:49,635
We can't just wait around.

142
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:52,012
Mike, in case you
forgot, we're still fugitives.

143
00:12:52,096 --> 00:12:53,472
The bad men are still looking for us.

144
00:12:53,556 --> 00:12:55,433
Yeah, and we don't even
know where your sister is.

145
00:12:55,516 --> 00:12:56,517
El can find them.

146
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,601
Mike, look at her.

147
00:12:58,561 --> 00:13:00,354
I still think we should
stick to the chief's plan.

148
00:13:00,438 --> 00:13:04,024
Exactly. We stay here, keep El
out of sight and keep her safe.

149
00:13:04,108 --> 00:13:05,901
That's the most
important thing, remember?

150
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,903
Besides, she's
okay. She's with Jonathan.

151
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:10,406
Yeah, and she's kind
of a badass now, so...

152
00:13:11,365 --> 00:13:13,784
Well, where are you going? You
just said stick to the plan!

153
00:13:13,868 --> 00:13:16,245
I am. I'm just gonna go
get some chocolate pudding.

154
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,414
I'm telling you, Lunch Lady
Phyllis hoards that shit.

155
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:19,749
Are you serious?

156
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,500
El needs to be recharged!

157
00:13:42,438 --> 00:13:43,731
Did you hear that?

158
00:13:46,484 --> 00:13:47,985
It's just the wind.

159
00:13:53,657 --> 00:13:55,117
Don't worry.

160
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:58,537
My mom, she said the
lights speak when it comes.

161
00:13:58,621 --> 00:13:59,705
Speak?

162
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:01,832
Blink.

163
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,001
Think of them as alarms.

164
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,554
Is that too tight?

165
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:16,931
No, it's fine.

166
00:14:17,014 --> 00:14:18,224
Thanks.

167
00:14:29,693 --> 00:14:30,778
Nancy?

168
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,240
Yeah?

169
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,203
Jonathan?

170
00:14:40,287 --> 00:14:42,623
Are you there, man? It's... it's Steve!

171
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:45,208
Listen, I just want to talk!

172
00:14:48,546 --> 00:14:49,922
- Steve, listen to me.
- Hey. Nancy, what...

173
00:14:50,047 --> 00:14:50,767
You need to leave.

174
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:52,487
I'm not trying to start anything, okay?

175
00:14:52,508 --> 00:14:53,676
I don't care about
that. You need to leave.

176
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,096
No, no, no.
Listen, I messed up, okay?

177
00:14:57,179 --> 00:14:58,847
I messed... I messed up.

178
00:14:58,931 --> 00:14:59,932
Okay?

179
00:15:00,015 --> 00:15:01,767
Really. Please.

180
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:03,394
I just want to make things right.

181
00:15:04,562 --> 00:15:06,772
Okay? Please. Please...

182
00:15:08,983 --> 00:15:10,276
Hey, what happened to your hand?

183
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:11,610
Is that blood?

184
00:15:11,694 --> 00:15:13,445
Nothing.  It was an accident.

185
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:15,406
- Yeah, what's going on?
- Nothing.

186
00:15:15,489 --> 00:15:17,282
- Wait a sec. Did he do this to you?
- No.

187
00:15:17,366 --> 00:15:19,660
- Nancy, let me in!
- No. No! No, Steve!

188
00:15:20,995 --> 00:15:22,705
- What is... What the...
- You need to get out of here.

189
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,581
- Whoa. What is all...
- Listen to me. I'm not asking you,

190
00:15:24,665 --> 00:15:26,208
- I'm telling you, get out of here!
- What is that smell?

191
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,710
- Is that... is that gasoline?
- Steve, get out!

192
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:30,504
Wait. What? What is going on?

193
00:15:30,588 --> 00:15:31,881
You have five
seconds to get out of here.

194
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,382
Okay, is this a joke?
Stop. Put the gun down.

195
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,258
- I'm doing this for you.
- Nancy.

196
00:15:35,342 --> 00:15:36,510
- Wait. Is this a... What is this?
- Nancy.

197
00:15:36,594 --> 00:15:38,596
- Three. Two.
- No, no, no! No, no!

198
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:40,389
Nancy! The lights.

199
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,267
- It's here.
- Wait, what's here?

200
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,351
- Where is it?
- Where is what? Whoa!

201
00:15:44,435 --> 00:15:45,937
- Easy with that!
- Where is it?

202
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,180
I don't know. I don't see it.

203
00:15:47,188 --> 00:15:48,189
Where is what?

204
00:15:48,272 --> 00:15:51,025
Hello? Will someone please
explain to me what the hell is going...

205
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,155
No!

206
00:15:56,238 --> 00:15:58,657
Go! Go! Run! Go!

207
00:15:58,741 --> 00:16:00,076
Get out of here!

208
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,122
- Jump!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

209
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,626
Jesus! Jesus! What the hell was that?

210
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:10,127
- What the hell was that?
- Shut up!

211
00:16:18,052 --> 00:16:19,053
What's it doing?

212
00:16:20,095 --> 00:16:21,263
I don't know.

213
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,320
Do you hear anything?

214
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,280
No.

215
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:36,964
Will!

216
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:38,549
Will!

217
00:17:43,387 --> 00:17:45,347
Will!

218
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:51,437
Will!

219
00:18:03,157 --> 00:18:06,327
"I asked Mrs. Spencer what
made them red and she said she didn't know

220
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,287
and for pity's sake not to
ask her any more questions.

221
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,163
She said I must have asked
her a thousand already.

222
00:18:10,247 --> 00:18:11,373
I suppose I had, too,

223
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:14,460
but how are you gonna find things
out if you don't ask questions?

224
00:18:14,543 --> 00:18:16,420
And what does make roads red?

225
00:18:16,503 --> 00:18:18,255
'Well, I don't know, ' said Matthew.

226
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:20,967
It just makes me feel
glad to be alive...

227
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,261
it's such an interesting world."

228
00:18:41,028 --> 00:18:42,613
Will!

229
00:18:46,033 --> 00:18:47,368
Will!

230
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,654
This is crazy. This is
crazy. This is crazy.

231
00:19:24,738 --> 00:19:26,990
This is crazy! This is
crazy! This is crazy!

232
00:19:29,952 --> 00:19:32,121
What are you do... What are
you doing? Are you insane?

233
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:33,372
It's going to come back!

234
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:35,207
So you need to leave.

235
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,167
Right now.

236
00:20:00,816 --> 00:20:02,025
Where is it?

237
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:05,404
Come on. Come
on, you son of a bitch.

238
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:07,406
- You see it?
- No. Where...

239
00:20:07,489 --> 00:20:08,574
Come on.

240
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:11,285
Where are you? Come on!

241
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,375
Jonathan!

242
00:20:19,835 --> 00:20:21,170
Jonathan!

243
00:20:21,837 --> 00:20:23,380
Jonathan!

244
00:20:27,384 --> 00:20:29,761
Go to hell, you son of a bitch!

245
00:20:43,901 --> 00:20:46,737
Steve!

246
00:20:57,831 --> 00:20:59,041
He's in the trap!

247
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,587
- He's stuck!
- Jonathan, now!

248
00:21:12,596 --> 00:21:14,056
Did you hear that?

249
00:21:20,437 --> 00:21:23,106
Get back!

250
00:21:42,793 --> 00:21:44,628
- Where did it go?
- No.

251
00:21:44,711 --> 00:21:46,129
It has to be dead.

252
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:48,382
It has to be.

253
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:59,059
Come on.

254
00:21:59,142 --> 00:22:01,019
Is that my house?

255
00:22:33,427 --> 00:22:34,970
It was hurt.

256
00:23:09,379 --> 00:23:10,380
Mom.

257
00:23:10,464 --> 00:23:12,383
Is that you?

258
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:15,927
Mom.

259
00:23:17,846 --> 00:23:19,097
Jonathan?

260
00:23:22,726 --> 00:23:24,686
Joyce, come on.

261
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:37,866
Where's it going?

262
00:23:39,326 --> 00:23:41,286
I don't think that's the monster.

263
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:48,960
Found it! I knew she was hoarding it.

264
00:23:49,044 --> 00:23:50,379
- I knew it.
- Yeah.

265
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:51,922
Always lying, saying she's out.

266
00:23:52,005 --> 00:23:53,590
Bald-faced liar.

267
00:23:53,673 --> 00:23:56,968
Mike, I found the chocolate pudding!

268
00:23:57,052 --> 00:23:58,428
Okay!

269
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:00,722
Are you feeling any better?

270
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:06,144
What's "putting"?

271
00:24:06,228 --> 00:24:07,855
Pudding, it's...

272
00:24:07,938 --> 00:24:09,698
it's this chocolate
goo you eat with a spoon.

273
00:24:10,023 --> 00:24:11,024
Don't worry,

274
00:24:11,108 --> 00:24:13,319
when all this is over, you
won't have to keep eating junk food

275
00:24:13,402 --> 00:24:15,029
and leftovers like a dog anymore.

276
00:24:15,112 --> 00:24:17,280
My mom, she's a pretty awesome cook.

277
00:24:17,364 --> 00:24:18,865
She can make you whatever you like.

278
00:24:18,949 --> 00:24:20,242
Eggos?

279
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:23,578
Well, yeah, Eggos, but real food, too.

280
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:27,416
See, I was thinking,

281
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:30,752
once all this is over and Will's
back and you're not a secret anymore,

282
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:33,339
my parents can get you an
actual bed for the basement.

283
00:24:33,422 --> 00:24:35,132
Or you can take my room if you want,

284
00:24:35,215 --> 00:24:37,759
since I'm down there
all the time anyways.

285
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:39,970
My point is, they'll take care of you.

286
00:24:40,053 --> 00:24:41,763
They'll be like your new parents,

287
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:44,599
and Nancy, she'll be
like your new sister.

288
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,477
Will you be like my brother?

289
00:24:47,561 --> 00:24:50,272
What? No, no.

290
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:51,898
Why "no"?

291
00:24:51,982 --> 00:24:53,358
Because...

292
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,485
'cause it's different.

293
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:56,820
Why?

294
00:24:56,903 --> 00:24:59,948
I mean, I don't
know, I guess it's not.

295
00:25:00,907 --> 00:25:02,325
It's stupid.

296
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:04,619
Mike?

297
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:05,871
Yeah?

298
00:25:05,954 --> 00:25:08,081
Friends don't lie.

299
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:10,375
Well...

300
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:12,752
I was thinking...

301
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:15,047
I don't know...

302
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,883
maybe we can go to
the Snow Ball together.

303
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:20,927
- "Snow Ball"?
- It's this cheesy school dance,

304
00:25:21,011 --> 00:25:23,722
where you go in the gym and
dance to music and stuff.

305
00:25:23,805 --> 00:25:26,605
I've never been, but I know you're
not supposed to go with your sister.

306
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:29,311
- No?
- I mean...

307
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:31,521
you can, but it'd be really weird.

308
00:25:31,605 --> 00:25:35,275
You go to school dances with
someone that, you know...

309
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:37,861
someone that you like.

310
00:25:37,944 --> 00:25:39,905
- A friend?
- Not a friend.

311
00:25:39,988 --> 00:25:42,365
Uh... uh...

312
00:25:43,366 --> 00:25:45,035
Uh, someone like a...

313
00:26:01,218 --> 00:26:03,053
Nancy. Hold on, I'll be right back.

314
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,471
Stay here.

315
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:21,071
Go!

316
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,573
You two, on me.

317
00:26:25,992 --> 00:26:28,828
This will charge your battery
right up, I'm telling you.

318
00:26:28,912 --> 00:26:31,373
- Guys! Guys!
- What is it?

319
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:34,042
They found us.

320
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,752
We know they're here.

321
00:26:38,255 --> 00:26:40,382
Be advised, west side
of the building is clear.

322
00:26:43,385 --> 00:26:45,905
Sir, we've searched
everywhere. There's no sign of them.

323
00:26:50,392 --> 00:26:51,434
Nothin'.

324
00:26:54,104 --> 00:26:55,772
Keep it locked down.

325
00:26:55,855 --> 00:26:57,065
All right.

326
00:26:58,191 --> 00:26:59,192
Kitchen.

327
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:06,533
How did they find us?

328
00:27:06,616 --> 00:27:08,118
I don't know, but they
knew we were in the gym.

329
00:27:08,201 --> 00:27:09,369
Lando.

330
00:27:11,288 --> 00:27:12,968
- Got 'em!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

331
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:14,165
Come on!

332
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:17,299
- There they are. Freeze.
- Back! Go back!

333
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:19,129
Go, go! Go left!

334
00:27:47,574 --> 00:27:50,076
El, are you okay?

335
00:27:50,619 --> 00:27:51,745
El!

336
00:27:51,828 --> 00:27:53,163
- Something's wrong.
- She's just drained.

337
00:27:53,246 --> 00:27:55,582
No, no, no, she won't wake up. El!

338
00:27:55,665 --> 00:27:57,334
El!  El!

339
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:00,754
There's more blood.

340
00:28:08,094 --> 00:28:09,387
Oh, my God.

341
00:28:12,474 --> 00:28:14,100
This way.

342
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:11,908
- She's barely breathing.
- We gotta go.

343
00:29:11,992 --> 00:29:12,993
Leave her.

344
00:29:16,663 --> 00:29:18,873
- Step away from the child.
- No!

345
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:20,667
You want her, you have to kill us first.

346
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,544
- That's right!
- Eat shit!

347
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:24,421
- Oh, no! No, no!
- No! No! Get off me!

348
00:29:24,546 --> 00:29:26,840
- You idiot!
- No!

349
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:30,051
- Get off me!
- Ow! Let go!

350
00:29:31,052 --> 00:29:33,304
Eleven? Eleven, can you hear me?

351
00:29:33,388 --> 00:29:34,431
Eleven?

352
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,391
Papa?

353
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:38,935
Yes, yes, it's your papa.

354
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:40,854
- Get off of me.
- I'm here now.

355
00:29:40,937 --> 00:29:43,982
Let her go! Let her go, you bastard!

356
00:29:45,692 --> 00:29:47,819
Shh, shh, you're sick.

357
00:29:47,902 --> 00:29:49,988
You're sick, but I'm
going to make you better.

358
00:29:50,071 --> 00:29:53,908
I'm going to take you back
home, where I can make you well again.

359
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:55,910
Where we can make all of this better,

360
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,912
so no one else gets hurt.

361
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,418
Bad.

362
00:30:05,462 --> 00:30:06,588
Bad.

363
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:13,511
Mike. Mike.

364
00:30:13,595 --> 00:30:15,263
Mike.

365
00:30:20,727 --> 00:30:21,770
Blood.

366
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,063
What?

367
00:30:23,646 --> 00:30:24,689
Blood.

368
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:44,793
Demogorgon.

369
00:30:48,838 --> 00:30:50,048
Go, go, go, go, go!

370
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,485
- Come on, come on. 
- Go, go!

371
00:32:01,703 --> 00:32:03,538
Oh, my God.

372
00:32:27,896 --> 00:32:30,190
Will! Will!

373
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,860
Will! Oh, my God!

374
00:32:33,943 --> 00:32:36,279
Will! Hopper!

375
00:32:36,362 --> 00:32:39,199
Oh, my God! You need
to help get him out!

376
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:41,613
Get him out!

377
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:58,843
Oh, Jesus.

378
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,000
Come on, come on!

379
00:33:02,055 --> 00:33:03,723
Oh, my God!

380
00:33:07,644 --> 00:33:09,896
Sorry. Hold on, we're almost
there. We're almost there.

381
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:14,817
Come on.  Come on.

382
00:33:16,402 --> 00:33:17,779
Help, help.

383
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:19,530
Come on, get her on the table.

384
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:25,245
Just hold on a little
longer, okay?

385
00:33:25,328 --> 00:33:28,122
He's gone. The bad man's gone.

386
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:31,292
We'll be home soon, and my mom...

387
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:33,878
she'll get you your own bed.

388
00:33:34,087 --> 00:33:36,464
You can eat as many Eggos as you want.

389
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:40,677
And we can
go to the Snow Ball.

390
00:33:44,681 --> 00:33:46,099
Promise?

391
00:33:47,308 --> 00:33:49,352
Promise.

392
00:34:06,035 --> 00:34:08,037
Is... Is it dead?

393
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:13,334
Go, go, go, go!

394
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:15,378
Get the wrist
rocket! Get the wrist rocket now!

395
00:34:15,461 --> 00:34:17,547
Go, go, go, go, go!

396
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,299
- Go, go, go.
- Take it out now!

397
00:34:19,382 --> 00:34:20,508
Get the rocks, get the
rocks, get the rocks!

398
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:21,592
Getting the rocks!

399
00:34:21,676 --> 00:34:23,052
- Give me one.
- Come on!

400
00:34:23,136 --> 00:34:24,470
- Go! Go! Kill it! Kill it!
- Fire! Fire!

401
00:34:25,805 --> 00:34:27,515
- Give me another one.
- Kill it! Bastard!

402
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:29,684
- Kill it! Go, go, go, go!
- Kill it now!

403
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,936
Get, get, get... Come
on, kill the bastard!

404
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,021
It's not working!

405
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:34,856
- Hit him again.
- Kill him!

406
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:36,899
- Keep going! Come on!
- Get, get, get...

407
00:34:36,983 --> 00:34:39,027
- Come on, kill it!
- Come on! Go, go, go!

408
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,719
Eleven, stop!

409
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:36,918
Goodbye, Mike.

410
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:57,939
No more.

411
00:36:51,117 --> 00:36:53,411
El? El?

412
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:55,371
- El!
- Eleven!

413
00:36:55,455 --> 00:36:57,457
- Eleven!
- El!

414
00:36:58,291 --> 00:36:59,793
El, where are you?

415
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,920
Eleven!

416
00:37:03,045 --> 00:37:04,255
El?

417
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:09,885
Oh, God.

418
00:37:11,846 --> 00:37:13,973
He's not
breathing, he's not breathing.

419
00:37:14,056 --> 00:37:16,476
All right, Joyce, Joyce, listen
to me, listen to me, listen to me.

420
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:18,352
- I need you to tilt his head back...
- Okay.

421
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:20,354
- and lift his chin.
- Okay.

422
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:21,939
One, two, three, four.

423
00:37:22,023 --> 00:37:23,024
Now when I tell you,

424
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:26,903
you're gonna pinch his
nostrils, and breathe into his mouth...

425
00:37:26,986 --> 00:37:28,905
- twice.
- Okay.

426
00:37:28,988 --> 00:37:30,031
One second...

427
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:31,616
then pause.

428
00:37:31,699 --> 00:37:33,367
22, 23.

429
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:34,494
- Then one second.
- Okay.

430
00:37:34,577 --> 00:37:36,579
24, 25, 26, 27, 28...

431
00:37:36,662 --> 00:37:39,540
29, 30. Now! Go!

432
00:37:43,586 --> 00:37:45,306
- Oh, come on, come on.
- Come on...

433
00:37:45,671 --> 00:37:47,215
Come on, kid.

434
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:48,424
- Come on, kid!
- Will!

435
00:37:48,508 --> 00:37:49,717
Will, listen to me.

436
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,053
It's me, it's your mom
and I love you so much.

437
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:53,262
I love you so much.

438
00:37:53,346 --> 00:37:56,557
I love you more than
anything in the world.

439
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:58,559
Please...

440
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:01,163
Blood pressure keeps dropping.

441
00:38:02,605 --> 00:38:04,106
Her pulse ox is falling.

442
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:07,902
I love you so much. I love you
more than anything in the world.

443
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:10,738
Please, please
come back to me. Just...

444
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:12,990
- Come on, kid!
- Please, please wake up.

445
00:38:13,074 --> 00:38:14,283
Please, please.

446
00:38:14,367 --> 00:38:16,285
Breathe, Will, come on!

447
00:38:16,369 --> 00:38:18,621
Flatlining!

448
00:38:21,749 --> 00:38:23,349
Come
back to me, breathe.

449
00:38:23,709 --> 00:38:25,002
I need you to wake up now.

450
00:38:25,086 --> 00:38:26,420
I need you to breathe.

451
00:38:26,546 --> 00:38:28,047
Please breathe!

452
00:38:29,757 --> 00:38:30,883
Please!

453
00:38:32,969 --> 00:38:34,053
That's it.

454
00:38:34,136 --> 00:38:37,264
Oh, my God, that's it, that's it.

455
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:40,851
That's it, baby. Breathe.

456
00:38:40,935 --> 00:38:43,062
Breathe. All right. Come on.

457
00:38:43,145 --> 00:38:44,522
Come on.

458
00:38:44,605 --> 00:38:46,691
Breathe, breathe, come on, come on.

459
00:38:46,774 --> 00:38:48,484
Good, good, good, good.

460
00:38:48,568 --> 00:38:51,654
Just breathe, Will, breathe.

461
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:24,604
Michael?

462
00:39:26,647 --> 00:39:27,857
Michael!

463
00:39:31,611 --> 00:39:32,862
Michael?

464
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:39,076
Oh, my God.

465
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,620
Oh, my God.

466
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:42,747
You're okay.

467
00:39:44,457 --> 00:39:45,458
You're okay.

468
00:40:23,037 --> 00:40:24,497
Hey.

469
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,374
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey.

470
00:40:29,168 --> 00:40:31,337
Where... where am I?

471
00:40:34,215 --> 00:40:36,342
You're home. You're home now.

472
00:40:37,176 --> 00:40:38,219
You're safe.

473
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:39,929
Jonathan.

474
00:40:41,847 --> 00:40:43,641
Yeah, it's me, buddy.

475
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:47,520
We missed you.

476
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:50,439
We really missed you.

477
00:40:51,774 --> 00:40:52,983
Are you okay?

478
00:40:54,193 --> 00:40:55,361
What, this?

479
00:40:56,362 --> 00:40:58,572
It's just a cut. It's nothing.

480
00:41:00,533 --> 00:41:02,493
You're worried about my hand.

481
00:41:06,789 --> 00:41:08,165
Oh, hey, uh...

482
00:41:08,749 --> 00:41:09,875
We, uh...

483
00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:12,169
We brought you some stuff...

484
00:41:13,212 --> 00:41:14,839
so you don't get bored in here.

485
00:41:15,464 --> 00:41:16,674
So...

486
00:41:18,634 --> 00:41:21,721
Uh, I made you a new mix tape.

487
00:41:22,263 --> 00:41:25,224
There's some stuff on there I
think you really might like.

488
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:13,983
Guys. Guys, he's up. Will
is up. Guys, Will's up.

489
00:42:15,524 --> 00:42:16,776
Guys, come on.

490
00:42:20,112 --> 00:42:21,447
Byers!

491
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:23,324
Be careful. Be careful with him.

492
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:24,992
- Move.
- Guys, guys.

493
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:26,827
Go easy on him.

494
00:42:27,495 --> 00:42:29,414
You won't believe what
happened when you were gone, man.

495
00:42:29,497 --> 00:42:31,178
- It was mental.
- You had a funeral.

496
00:42:31,207 --> 00:42:33,042
- Jennifer Hayes was crying.
- And Troy peed himself.

497
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:34,793
- What?
- In front of the whole school!

498
00:42:34,877 --> 00:42:35,920
Yes!

499
00:42:41,175 --> 00:42:42,385
You okay?

500
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:44,470
It got me.

501
00:42:45,387 --> 00:42:46,639
The Demogorgon.

502
00:42:46,722 --> 00:42:48,182
We know.

503
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:49,266
It's okay.

504
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:50,726
It's dead.

505
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:51,936
We made a new friend.

506
00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:54,980
She stopped it. She saved us.

507
00:42:55,815 --> 00:42:56,941
But she's gone now.

508
00:42:58,567 --> 00:43:00,611
- Her name's Eleven.
- Like the number?

509
00:43:00,694 --> 00:43:02,015
Well, we call her "El" for short.

510
00:43:02,029 --> 00:43:03,113
She's basically a wizard.

511
00:43:03,197 --> 00:43:04,438
She has superpowers.

512
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:05,449
More like a Yoda.

513
00:43:05,533 --> 00:43:07,133
She flipped
a van with her mind,

514
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:08,327
and these agents were
trying to shoot us...

515
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:10,412
- Yeah, it flipped over us...
- Then she squeezed the brains out...

516
00:43:10,496 --> 00:43:12,540
And blood was pouring
out of their faces.

517
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:13,958
It was pouring out of their eyes.

518
00:43:14,041 --> 00:43:15,459
Agents just
started grabbing us and stuff...

519
00:43:15,543 --> 00:43:18,063
...shot out of the wall...

520
00:44:43,297 --> 00:44:45,841
Something is
coming. Something angry.

521
00:44:45,924 --> 00:44:47,176
Hungry for your blood.

522
00:44:47,259 --> 00:44:49,094
It is almost here.

523
00:44:49,178 --> 00:44:51,338
- What is it?
- It's the thessalhydra, I'm telling you.

524
00:44:51,347 --> 00:44:52,431
It's not the thessalhydra.

525
00:44:52,514 --> 00:44:54,075
I'm telling you, it's the thessalhydra.

526
00:44:54,141 --> 00:44:55,601
The thessalhydra!

527
00:44:55,684 --> 00:44:57,269
- Damn it.
- It roars in anger!

528
00:44:57,353 --> 00:44:59,113
- Will, your action!
- What should I do? I...

529
00:44:59,146 --> 00:45:00,856
Fireball him!

530
00:45:03,817 --> 00:45:05,027
Fireball the son of a bitch.

531
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:10,741
Fourteen!

532
00:45:10,824 --> 00:45:13,660
Direct hit. Will the Wise's
fireball hits the thessalhydra.

533
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:15,746
It makes a
painful...

534
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:18,791
and then... it crumbles to the ground.

535
00:45:18,874 --> 00:45:22,252
Its clawed hand reaches
for you one last time

536
00:45:22,336 --> 00:45:23,921
and, and, and...

537
00:45:24,004 --> 00:45:25,422
and...

538
00:45:32,221 --> 00:45:33,931
Lucas cuts off its seven heads,

539
00:45:34,014 --> 00:45:36,016
and Dustin places them
into his bag of holding.

540
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,310
You carry the heads out
of the dungeon, victorious,

541
00:45:38,394 --> 00:45:39,979
and you present them to King Tristan.

542
00:45:40,062 --> 00:45:41,438
He thanks you for your
bravery and service.

543
00:45:41,522 --> 00:45:44,483
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, that's not it, is it?

544
00:45:44,566 --> 00:45:45,859
No, there's a medal ceremony...

545
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:48,112
Oh, a medal ceremony? What
are you talking about?

546
00:45:48,195 --> 00:45:50,155
- And...
- The campaign was way too short.

547
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:51,782
- Yeah!
- It was ten hours!

548
00:45:51,865 --> 00:45:52,866
But it doesn't make any sense.

549
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,411
- It makes sense.
- Uh, no, what about the lost knight?

550
00:45:55,494 --> 00:45:56,954
And the proud princess?

551
00:45:57,037 --> 00:45:58,372
And those weird flowers in the cave?

552
00:45:58,455 --> 00:45:59,456
I don't know, it's...

553
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:01,875
Jeez, what's that smell?

554
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:03,627
Have you guys been playing
games all day, or just farting?

555
00:46:03,711 --> 00:46:05,171
Oh, that's just Dustin.

556
00:46:05,254 --> 00:46:06,422
He farted.

557
00:46:06,505 --> 00:46:07,840
- Dustin farted.
- Okay.

558
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:09,175
- Dustin farted.
- Very mature, Lucas.

559
00:46:09,258 --> 00:46:10,301
Oh.

560
00:46:10,384 --> 00:46:11,844
- Will.
- Shut up.

561
00:46:11,927 --> 00:46:12,970
- Come on.
- Dustin farted!

562
00:46:13,053 --> 00:46:15,055
- Bye, guys. 
- Bye, Will.

563
00:46:16,056 --> 00:46:17,683
See you, Will.

564
00:46:17,766 --> 00:46:20,102
- Stop.
- No, you stop.

565
00:46:20,185 --> 00:46:22,438
No, you stop.

566
00:46:23,897 --> 00:46:26,400
Yeah, scream! You're
like a little girl.

567
00:46:38,036 --> 00:46:39,371
- So, you have fun?
- Yeah.

568
00:46:39,455 --> 00:46:40,498
Hey, boys.

569
00:46:40,581 --> 00:46:41,582
- Hey, Mrs. Wheeler.
- Hi.

570
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:43,667
Hey, wish your mom a
Merry Christmas for me, okay?

571
00:46:43,751 --> 00:46:45,591
- Yeah.
- Yeah, thank you. Uh, Merry Christmas.

572
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:47,004
Merry Christmas.

573
00:46:48,088 --> 00:46:49,673
- So, uh, you win?
- Yeah.

574
00:46:49,757 --> 00:46:52,426
- Awesome.
- Hey, Jonathan, wait up.

575
00:46:56,889 --> 00:46:58,640
- Uh...
- Merry Christmas.

576
00:46:58,724 --> 00:47:00,392
Thanks, um...

577
00:47:01,393 --> 00:47:02,895
I... I didn't get you anything.

578
00:47:02,978 --> 00:47:04,897
- I... I feel bad.
- No.

579
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:08,901
No, it's, uh, it's not really a present.

580
00:47:09,902 --> 00:47:13,113
It's, um... Well, you'll see.

581
00:47:21,121 --> 00:47:22,790
Merry Christmas.

582
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:25,709
- You ready? Let's go.
- Yeah.

583
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:32,049
All right. Buckle up.

584
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:38,388
Can I open it?

585
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:40,933
Yeah, sure.

586
00:47:43,852 --> 00:47:45,020
Whoa.

587
00:47:45,103 --> 00:47:46,104
Pretty cool.

588
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:49,483
Yeah.

589
00:47:50,484 --> 00:47:52,778
Yeah, pretty cool.

590
00:48:07,709 --> 00:48:09,002
Did you give it to him?

591
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,129
Yeah.

592
00:48:41,326 --> 00:48:42,702
You leaving already, Chief?

593
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:44,414
Oh, come on, you think I actually wanted

594
00:48:44,439 --> 00:48:46,105
to come to this
thing? I was just hungry.

595
00:48:46,164 --> 00:48:47,499
Oh, yeah, that's the spirit.

596
00:48:47,583 --> 00:48:50,586
Well, your wife doesn't have time to
cook for me, you know what I'm saying?

597
00:48:53,255 --> 00:48:54,423
Merry Christmas, Hop.

598
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:57,050
Mmm.

599
00:50:04,993 --> 00:50:07,537
What you got there?

600
00:50:07,621 --> 00:50:08,664
That one of yours?

601
00:50:08,747 --> 00:50:10,749
- Yeah.
- Looks pretty big.

602
00:50:13,627 --> 00:50:15,420
Be careful. You'll break it.

603
00:50:20,801 --> 00:50:22,636
What are you... What are you doing?

604
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:24,137
Documenting.

605
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:25,597
Oh, why?

606
00:50:25,681 --> 00:50:27,057
Because...

607
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:30,310
- It looks great.
- Oh, this is just so overcooked.

608
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:32,938
- And look, the potatoes are runny.
- Mom.

609
00:50:33,021 --> 00:50:36,358
- They're so runny.
- Mom, it's gonna be great.

610
00:50:36,441 --> 00:50:38,944
- It's definitely an Atari.
- An a-what-i?

611
00:50:39,027 --> 00:50:40,347
The green present. It's an Atari.

612
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:43,031
I felt Dustin's today, it's
the same exact weight.

613
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:45,993
- Really? Well...
- Yeah.

614
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:51,372
We'll have to see, won't
we? Hey, no more snooping.

615
00:50:51,456 --> 00:50:53,625
No, I forgot to wash my
hands. I'll be right back.

616
00:50:53,709 --> 00:50:54,919
Okay.

617
00:50:55,836 --> 00:50:58,046
He's washing his hands?

618
00:51:37,919 --> 00:51:40,088
Thanks.

619
00:51:43,383 --> 00:51:44,468
Are you okay?

620
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:47,387
Yeah, I'm okay.

621
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:49,181
Mmm. Very good, Mom.

622
00:51:50,348 --> 00:51:53,393
Mmm. Hey, Mom. Did Will
tell you about, uh, the game?

623
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:54,645
- Oh, yeah.
- No. What game?

624
00:51:54,728 --> 00:51:57,049
I threw a fireball at him
and...  dead.

625
00:51:57,105 --> 00:51:59,399
Wait, what is... You mean, this is...

626
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:00,985
No, it's just Dungeons & Dragons.

627
00:52:01,068 --> 00:52:02,820
- Dungeons & Dragons. Right.
- It's fun.

628
00:52:15,917 --> 00:52:19,970
