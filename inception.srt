I know what this is.

55
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:28,939
I've seen one before.
Many, many years ago.

56
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:34,444
It belonged to a man I met
in a half-remembered dream.

57
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:42,578
A man possessed
of some radical notions.

What is the most resilient parasite?

59
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,921
A bacteria? A virus?

00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,756
An intestinal worm?

<font color="#808080">ARTHUR :</font>
Uh...

62
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,135
What Mr. Cobb is trying to say...

63
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,511
An idea.

64
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,307
Resilient. Highly contagious.

65
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:06,476
Once an idea has taken hold of the brain,
it's almost impossible to eradicate.

66
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:12,190
An idea that is fully formed,
fully understood, that sticks.

67
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,609
Right in there somewhere.

68
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,319
For someone like you to steal?

69
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:18,447
Yes. In the dream state,
your conscious defenses are lowered...

70
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,033
...and that makes your thoughts
vulnerable to theft.

71
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,451
It's called extraction.

72
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:26,163
Mr. Saito, we can train
your subconscious to defend itself...

73
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,832
...from even the most skilled extractor.

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,167
How can you do that?

75
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,170
Because I am the most skilled extractor.

76
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,049
I know how to search your mind
and find your secrets. I know the tricks.

77
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:40,135
And I can teach them to you,
so that even when you're asleep...

78
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,638
...your defense is never down.

79
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:47,476
Look, if you want my help, you're gonna
have to be completely open with me.

80
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,979
I need to know my way around
your thoughts better than your wife...

81
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,482
...better than your therapist,
better than anyone.

82
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,568
If this is a dream,
and you have a safe full of secrets...

83
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,071
...I need to know what's in that safe.

84
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:02,699
In order for this all to work,
you need to completely let me in.

But I can.

When we're asleep,
our mind can do almost anything.

Such as?

357

Imagine you're designing a building.
You consciously create each aspect.

358
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:23,497
But sometimes, it feels like it's almost
creating itself, if you know what I mean.

Genuine inspiration, right?

361
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,588
Now, in a dream,
our mind continuously does this.

362
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:36,385
We create and perceive
our world simultaneously.

363
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,972
And our mind does this so well
that we don't even know it's happening.

364
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,850
That allows us to get right
in the middle of that process.

- By taking over the creating part.

We bring the subject into that dream,
and they fill it with their subconscious.

to make them think that it's reality?

while we're in them, right?

something was actually strange.

Let me ask you a question.

the beginning of a dream, do you?

Have you done it before?

- No, it's not just about depth.

of the idea...

500
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:17,757
...in order for it to grow naturally
in your subject's mind. It's a subtle art.

501
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,468
So, what is this idea
that you need to plant?

502
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:24,848
We need the heir of a major corporation

In a dream, you can cheat architecture

A dream within a dream? Two levels?

588
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:48,796
Three.

589
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:52,550
Not possible. That many dreams
within dreams is too unstable.

590
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:56,679
It is possible.
You just have to add a sedative.

591
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,515
A powerful sedative.

592
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,561
- How many team members?
- Five.

593
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,438

Six.

is if I go in with you.

595
00:42:10,527 --> 00:42:13,613
There's no room for tourists
on a job like this, Mr. Saito.

596
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,157
This time, it seems there is.

597
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:20,828
This, I think, is a good place to start.
I use it every day.

610
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,010
Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?

Yeah, yeah. Everything's just fine.

622
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:36,422

What's your problem with this Mr. Fischer?

624

That's not your concern.

625
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:45,014
Mr. Saito, this isn't your typical
corporate espionage.

626
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,766
You asked me for inception.

627
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:50,311
I do hope you understand
the gravity of that request.

00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:54,440
Now, the seed that we plant
in this man's mind will grow into an idea.

00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,484
This idea will define him.

00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,486
It may come to change...

631
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,947
Well, it may come to change
everything about him.

632
00:45:01,114 --> 00:45:05,451
We're the last company standing
between them and total energy dominance.

633
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,703
And we can no longer compete.

634
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:11,332
Soon, they'll control the energy supply
of half the world.

635
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,876
In effect, they become
a new superpower.

636
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:18,631
The world needs Robert Fischer
to change his mind.

637
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,341

That's where we come in.

How is Robert Fischer's relationship
with his father?

639
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,681
Rumor is the relationship
is quite complicated.

640
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,350
Well, we can't work based
solely on rumor, can we?

641
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:32,728
Can you get me access to this man here?
Browning.

642
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:37,066
Fischer Senior's right-hand man.
Fischer Junior's godfather.

643
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:40,486
It should be possible,
if you can get the right references.

644
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:45,157
References are something
of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito.

Not sure that's necessary.

Must be a cherished memory of his.

00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:03,235
I put it beside his bed.
He hasn't even noticed.

660
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:05,071
Robert...

661
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:09,825
...we need to talk about
a power of attorney.

662
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:13,287
- I know this is hard, but it's imperative...
- Not now, Uncle Peter.

663
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:19,085
<font color="#808080">EAMES :</font>
The vultures are circling.

664
00:47:19,252 --> 00:47:23,673
And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes,
the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.

665
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,258
I've had ample opportunity
to observe Browning...

666
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:31,263
...and adopt his physical presence, study
his mannerisms, and so on and so forth.

667
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:35,267
So now in the first layer of the dream,
I can impersonate Browning.

668
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:38,688
And suggest concepts
to Fischer's conscious mind.

669
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:40,690
Then, when we take him
a level deeper...

670
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:44,360
...his own projection of Browning
should feed that right back to him.

671
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,445
So he gives himself the idea.

672
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:50,866
Precisely. That's the only way it will stick.
It has to seem self-generated.

673
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:54,453
Eames, I am impressed.

00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:21,522
Were you going under on your own?

677
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,192
No, no, I was just, uh, running
some experiments.

678
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,319
I didn't realize anyone was here, so...

679
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:30,156
Yeah, I was just...
I was working on my totem, actually.

680
00:48:30,323 --> 00:48:31,490
Here, let me take a look.

681
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,994
So you're learning, huh?

682
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:38,664
An elegant solution
for keeping track of reality.

683

- Was it your idea?
- No, it was, uh...

684
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,003
It was Mal's, actually. This...

685
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:48,466
This one was hers. She would spin it
in the dream and it would never topple.

686
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:51,552
Just spin and spin.

687
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:55,014
Arthur told me she passed away.

688
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:59,018
How are the mazes coming along?

689
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:02,063
Each level relates to the part
of the subject's subconscious...

690
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,689
...that we are trying to access.

691
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:09,320
So I'm making the bottom level a hospital,
so Fischer will bring his father.

692
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:12,448
You know, l... Actually, I have a question
about this layout.

693
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:17,369
No, no, no. Don't show me specifics.
Only the dreamer should know the layout.

694
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:18,704
Why is that so important?

695
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,873
In case one of us brings in
our projections.

696
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,375
We don't want them knowing
the details of the maze.

697
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:27,213
You mean in case you bring Mal in.

698
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:29,799
You can't keep her out, can you?

699
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,218
- Right.
- You can't build...

700
00:49:32,385 --> 00:49:35,721
...because if you know the maze,
then she knows it.

701
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:38,057
Well, she'd sabotage
the whole operation.

702
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:41,060
- Cobb, do the others know?
- No. No, they don't.

703
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,437
You've gotta warn them
if this is getting worse.

704
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:45,564
No one said it's getting worse.

705
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:50,069
I need to get home.
That's all I care about right now.

706
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,988
Why can't you go home?

707
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,119
Because they think I killed her.

708
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:03,624
- Thank you.
- For what?

709
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:06,085
For not asking whether I did.

710
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,420
"I will split up my father's empire."

711
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:12,800
Now, this is obviously an idea that
Robert himself would choose to reject...

712
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:15,761
...which is why we need to plant it deep
in his subconscious.

713
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:19,473
The subconscious is motivated
by emotion, right? Not reason.

714
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:23,435
We need to find a way to translate this
into an emotional concept.

715
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:26,021
How do you translate business strategy
into emotion?

716
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:29,775
That's what we're here to figure out.
Robert's relationship with his father...

717
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:32,695
...is stressed, to say the least.
- Can we run with that?

718
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:36,448
We suggest breaking up his father's
company as a "screw you" to the old man.

719
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:40,119
No, because I think positive emotion
trumps negative emotion every time.

720
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:44,206
We all yearn for reconciliation,
for catharsis.

721
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:48,127
We need Robert Fischer to have
a positive emotional reaction to all this.

722
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,129
All right, well, try this. Um...

723
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:55,050
"My father accepts that I want to create
for myself, not follow in his footsteps."

724
00:50:55,468 --> 00:50:56,510
That might work.

725
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:59,847
Might? We're gonna need to do
a little better than "might."

726
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,974
Thank you for your contribution, Arthur.

727
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:05,102
Forgive me for wanting
a little specificity, Eames.

728
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,395
Specificity?

729
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,397
Inception's not about being specific.

730
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:12,526
When we get inside his mind, we're
gonna have to work with what we find.

731
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,822
<font color="#808080">EAMES :</font> On the top level, we open up
his relationship with his father...

732

in my father's footsteps."

733
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:24,914
Then the next level down, we feed him,
"I will create something for myself."

734
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:28,417
Then, by the time we hit the bottom level,
we bring out the big guns.

Three layers down, the dreams are gonna

00:51:36,509 --> 00:51:37,676
Sedation.

739
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:40,679
For sleep stable enough to create
three layers of dreaming...

740
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:44,767
...we'll have to combine it with
an extremely powerful sedative.

<font color="#808080">YUSUF :</font> The compound we'll be using
to share the dream...

744
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,201
...creates a clear connection
between dreamers...

745
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:06,580
...whilst accelerating brain function.
- In other words, more time on each level.

746
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:09,875
Brain function in the dream will be
about 20 times normal.

747
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:13,587
And when you enter a dream within
that dream, the effect is compounded.

748
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:15,881
It's three dreams,
that's 10 hours times 20...

749
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:18,926
Math was never my strong subject.
How much time is that?

750
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,762
It's a week, the first level down.

751
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:25,307
Six months the second level down,
and the third level...

752
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:26,892
That's 10 years.

753
00:52:29,562 --> 00:52:31,730
Who'd wanna be stuck
in a dream for 10 years?

754
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:33,274
Depends on the dream.

755
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:35,734
So once we've made the plant,
how do we get out?

756
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:39,238
I'm hoping you have something more
elegant than shooting me in the head.

757
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:42,199
- A kick.
- What's a kick?

758
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:45,077
<font color="#808080">EAMES :</font>
This, Ariadne, would be a kick.

759
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:49,915
It's that feeling of falling you get
that jolts you awake.

760
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:53,294
- Snaps you out of the dream.
- We gonna feel a kick with this sedation?

761
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:54,670
<font color="#808080">YUSUF :</font>
That's the clever part.

762
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:58,090
I customized the sedative to leave
inner-ear function unimpaired.

763
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:03,095
That way, however deep the sleep,
the sleeper still feels falling.

764
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,597
Or tipping.

765
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:10,436
The trick is to synchronize a kick
that can penetrate all three levels.

766
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:14,481
We could use a musical countdown
to synchronize the different kicks.

01:12:29,344 --> 01:12:32,597
Maurice told me that when he passed,
you were the only one able to open it.

1026
01:12:32,764 --> 01:12:35,266
No, he never gave me any combination.

1027
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:40,146
Maybe he did. I mean, maybe you
just didn't know it was a combination.

1028
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:41,522
Well, what, then?

1029
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:44,233
I don't know, some meaningful
combination of numbers...

1030
01:12:44,401 --> 01:12:48,321
...based on your experiences
with Maurice.

1031
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:53,951
We didn't have very many, uh,
meaningful experiences together.

1032
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:56,162
Perhaps after your mother died.

1033
01:12:58,832 --> 01:13:01,542
After my mother died,
you know what he told me?

1034
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:08,174
"Robert,
there's really nothing to be said."

1035
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:10,676
Oh, well, he was bad with emotion.

1036
01:13:10,844 --> 01:13:13,554
I was 11, Uncle Peter.

1037
01:13:14,306 --> 01:13:17,558
- How's he doing?
- He's in a lot of pain.

1038
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:21,312
When we get down to the lower levels,
the pain will be less intense.

1039
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,730
And if he dies?

1040
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,358
Worst-case scenario?

1041
01:13:25,525 --> 01:13:28,236
When he wakes up,
his mind is completely gone.

1042
01:13:28,403 --> 01:13:32,490
Cobb, I'll still honor the arrangement.

1043
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:34,325
<font color="#808080">COBB :</font>
I appreciate that, Saito.

1044
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:38,579
But when you wake up, you won't even
remember that we had an arrangement.

1045
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:40,790
Limbo is gonna become your reality.

1046
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:44,710
You're gonna be lost down there so long
that you're gonna become an old man.

1047
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:46,504
Filled with regret?

1048
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:49,048
Waiting to die alone.

1049
01:13:49,716 --> 01:13:50,841
No.

1050
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:53,010
I'll come back.

1051
01:13:53,845 --> 01:13:56,514
And we'll be young men together again.

1052
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:03,521
Breathe.

1053
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:06,732
These people are gonna kill us
if we don't give them the combination.

1054
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,818
- They just wanna ransom us.
- I heard them.

1055
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:12,863
They're gonna lock us in that van,
and then drive it into the river.

1056
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:14,532
All right. What is in the safe?

1057
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:16,784
Something for you.

1058
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:21,539
Maurice always said
it was his most precious gift to you.

1059
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:25,376
- A will.
- Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.

1060
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:26,752
That's an alternate.

1061
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:29,297
This would supersede the other
if you want it to.

1062
01:14:29,464 --> 01:14:32,091
It splits up the component businesses
of Fischer Morrow.

1063
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:35,970
It'd be the end of the entire empire
as we know it.

1064
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:38,597
Destroying my whole inheritance?

1065
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:43,436
- Why would he suggest such a thing?
- I just don't know.

1066
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:48,274
He loved you, Robert.

1067
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:50,484
In his own way.

1068
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:52,445
<font color="#808080">FISCHER :</font>
In his own way.

1069
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:55,281
At the end...

1070
01:14:56,408 --> 01:14:58,743
...he called me in to his deathbed.

1071
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:01,078
He could barely speak.

1072
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:06,417
But he took the trouble
to tell me one last thing.

1073
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:10,546
He pulled me close.

1074
01:15:13,216 --> 01:15:15,301
And I could only make out...

1075
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:17,595
...one word.

1076
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:23,267
"Disappointed."

1077
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:28,773
<font color="#D900D9">(SIGHS)</font>

1078
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:30,107
When were you in limbo?

1079
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:35,196
You might have the rest of the team
convinced to carry on with this job.

1080
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:37,740
- But they don't know the truth.
- Truth? What truth?

1081
01:15:37,949 --> 01:15:42,078
The truth that, at any minute, you might
bring a freight train through the wall.

1082
01:15:42,245 --> 01:15:46,290
The truth that Mal is bursting
through your subconscious.

1083
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:48,876
And the truth that,
as we go deeper into Fischer...

1084
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:50,836
...we're also going deeper into you.

1085
01:15:51,671 --> 01:15:54,965
And I'm not sure
we're gonna like what we find.

1086
01:15:58,970 --> 01:16:00,429
We were working together.

1087
01:16:00,597 --> 01:16:04,266
We were exploring the concept
of a dream within a dream.

1088
01:16:04,476 --> 01:16:05,726
I kept pushing things.

1089
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:09,563
I wanted to go deeper and deeper.
I wanted to go further.

1090
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:14,944
I just didn't understand the concept that
hours could turn into years down there...

1091
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:17,822
...that we could get trapped so deep...

1092
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:21,992
...that when we wound up on the shore
of our own subconscious...

1093
01:16:22,577 --> 01:16:25,121
...we lost sight of what was real.

1094
01:16:31,169 --> 01:16:33,754
We created.
We built the world for ourselves.

1095
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:37,383
We did that for years.

1096
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:40,511
We built our own world.

1097
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:43,556
How long were you stuck there?

1098
01:16:44,724 --> 01:16:46,851
Something like 50 years.

1099
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:51,397
Jesus.

1100
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:55,025
How could you stand it?

1101
01:16:55,193 --> 01:16:57,945
It wasn't so bad at first,
feeling like gods.

1102
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:01,157
The problem was knowing
that none of it was real.

1103
01:17:01,324 --> 01:17:05,703
Eventually, it just became impossible
for me to live like that.

1104
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:07,288
And what about for her?

1105
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:14,670
She had locked something away,
something deep inside her.

1106
01:17:16,047 --> 01:17:21,302
A truth that she had once known,
but chose to forget.

1107
01:17:24,222 --> 01:17:26,724
Limbo became her reality.

1108
01:17:28,059 --> 01:17:29,894
What happened when you woke up?

1109
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:34,064
Well, to wake up from that
after years, after decades...

1110
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:39,653
...to become old souls thrown back
into youth like that?

1111
01:17:40,572 --> 01:17:44,325
I knew something was wrong with her.
She just wouldn't admit it.

1112
01:17:45,702 --> 01:17:47,953
Eventually, she told me the truth.

1113
01:17:48,413 --> 01:17:51,749
She was possessed by an idea.

1114
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:57,630
This one very simple idea
that changed everything.

1115
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:01,258
That our world wasn't real.

1116
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:06,430
That she needed to wake up
to come back to reality...

1117
01:18:06,973 --> 01:18:09,350
...that in order to get back home...

1118
01:18:10,602 --> 01:18:12,394
...we had to kill ourselves.

1119
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:22,488
- What about your children?
- She thought they were projections...

1120
01:18:22,656 --> 01:18:25,658
...that our real children were waiting
for us up there somewhere.

1121
01:18:25,825 --> 01:18:27,535
<font color="#808080">MAL :</font> I'm their mother!
<font color="#808080">COBB :</font> Calm down.

1122
01:18:27,702 --> 01:18:28,953
I can tell the difference.

1123
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,455
If this is my dream,
why can't I control this?

1124
01:18:31,623 --> 01:18:33,332
You don't know you're dreaming!

1125
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,709
<font color="#808080">COBB :</font> She was certain
there was nothing I could do...

1126
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:39,713
...no matter how much I begged,
no matter how much I pleaded.

1127
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:45,719
She wanted to do it,
but she could not do it alone.

1128
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:52,393
She loved me too much, so she came up
with a plan on our anniversary.

1129
01:19:18,461 --> 01:19:21,255
- Sweetheart, what are you doing?
- Join me.

1130
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:25,676
Just... Just step back inside. All right?
Just step back inside now, come on.

1131
01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:30,306
No. I'm going to jump,
and you're coming with me.

1132
01:19:30,473 --> 01:19:32,182
No, I'm not.

1133
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:34,435
Now, you listen to me.

1134
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:39,273
If you jump, you're not gonna wake up,
remember? You're gonna die.

1135
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:41,358
Now, just step back inside.

1136
01:19:41,526 --> 01:19:44,278
Come on. Step back inside
so we can talk about this.

1137
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:46,363
We've talked enough.

1138
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:50,117
- Mal.
- Come out onto the ledge...

1139
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:52,995
...or I'll jump right now.
- Okay.

1140
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:59,043
We're gonna talk about this.

1141
01:19:59,919 --> 01:20:01,086
All right?

1142
01:20:01,254 --> 01:20:06,342
- I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.
- No, honey.

1143
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:10,304
No, I can't. You know I can't do that.

1144
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:13,223
Take a second, think about our children.

1145
01:20:13,391 --> 01:20:15,142
Think about James.

1146
01:20:15,894 --> 01:20:17,519
Think about Phillipa, now.

1147
01:20:17,687 --> 01:20:20,606
If I go without you,
they'll take them away anyway.

1148
01:20:20,774 --> 01:20:24,068
- What does that mean?
- I filed a letter with our attorney...

1149
01:20:24,527 --> 01:20:27,863
...explaining how I'm fearful
for my safety.

1150
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:32,242
How you've threatened to kill me.

1151
01:20:35,038 --> 01:20:37,665
- Why did you do this?
- I love you, Dom.

1152
01:20:37,832 --> 01:20:39,583
Why did...? Why would you do this to me?

1153
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:42,628
I've freed you from the guilt
of choosing to leave them.

1154
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:45,839
We're going home to our real children.

1155
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:49,635
Oh, no, no, no, Mal, you listen to me,
all right? Mal, look at me, please?

1156
01:20:49,803 --> 01:20:51,095
You're waiting for a train.

1157
01:20:51,596 --> 01:20:55,182
- Mal, goddamn it, don't do this!
- A train that will take you far away.

1158
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:57,351
James and Phillipa are waiting for you!

1159
01:20:57,519 --> 01:21:01,355
You know where you hope this train
will take you, but you can't know for sure.

1160
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,732
- Mal, look at me!
- But it doesn't matter.

1161
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:07,111
- Mal, goddamn it! Mal, listen to me!
- Because you'll be together.

1162
01:21:07,278 --> 01:21:11,115
Sweetheart! Look at me! Mal, no!

1163
01:21:11,282 --> 01:21:12,700
Jesus Christ!

1164
01:21:16,204 --> 01:21:19,957
She had herself declared sane
by three different psychiatrists.

1165
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:24,294
It made it impossible for me to try
to explain the nature of her madness.

1166
01:21:24,462 --> 01:21:25,713
So I ran.

01:21:55,618 --> 01:21:58,162
And if we are gonna succeed in this...

1175
01:21:58,329 --> 01:22:03,333
...you have to forgive yourself,
and you're gonna have to confront her.

1176
01:22:03,501 --> 01:22:05,335
But you don't have to do that alone.

1177
01:22:05,503 --> 01:22:07,755
- No, you're not...
- I'm doing it for the others.

1178
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:13,510
Because they have no idea the risk
they've taken coming down here with you.

1179
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,100
We have to move.

1180
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:21,685
Time's up.

1181
01:22:21,853 --> 01:22:24,605
All right. I don't know any combination.

1182
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,858
- Not consciously, anyway.
<font color="#808080">COBB :</font> How about instinctively, huh?

1183
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:31,987
I got somebody in your father's office
right now ready to tap in the combination.

1184
01:22:32,155 --> 01:22:35,032
Give me the first six numbers
that come to your head right now.

1185
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,451
- I have no idea.
- Right now!

1186
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:39,870
I said, right now! Right now!

1187
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:43,916
Five, two, eight, four, nine, one.

1188
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,797
You'll have to do better than that.

What'd you get?

1192
01:23:08,983 --> 01:23:11,527
Relationship with his father
is worse than we imagined.

1193

This helps us how?

1194

The stronger the issues,
the more powerful the catharsis.

The projections are closing in quick.

1197

You mustn't be afraid to dream
a little bigger, darling.

1200
01:24:23,808 --> 01:24:26,810
We need to shift his animosity
from his father to his godfather.

1201
01:24:26,978 --> 01:24:30,981
- Destroy his one positive relationship?
- No, repair his relationship with his father...

1202
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:33,483
...whilst exposing his godfather's
true nature.

1203
01:24:33,651 --> 01:24:36,653
We should charge Fischer a lot more
than Saito for this job.

1204

His security is gonna
get worse as we go deeper.

his security's gonna be all over us.

1210

You drive carefully, all right?

gonna be unstable as hell.

one shot at that kick. We gotta make it.

it's coming. The rest is on you.

1322
01:32:13,778 --> 01:32:17,614
What do you remember
from before this dream?

1323
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:20,617
There was, um, a lot of gunfire.

1324
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:23,411
There was rain.

1325
01:32:23,954 --> 01:32:25,538
Uncle Peter.

1326
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:29,459
- Oh, my God, we've been kidnapped.
- Where were they holding you?

1327
01:32:32,463 --> 01:32:35,757
- They had us in the back of a van.
- That explains the gravity shifts.

1328
01:32:35,966 --> 01:32:38,009
You're in the back of a van.
Keep going.

1329
01:32:38,177 --> 01:32:40,470
It had something to do with, um...

1330
01:32:41,097 --> 01:32:43,973
Something to do with a safe.

1331
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:46,226
God, why is it so hard to remember?

1332
01:32:46,393 --> 01:32:49,104
It's like trying to remember a dream
after you've woken up.

1333
01:32:49,271 --> 01:32:50,980
Listen, it takes years of practice.

1334
01:32:51,148 --> 01:32:53,566
You and Browning have been pulled
into this dream...

1335
01:32:53,734 --> 01:32:56,486
...because they're trying to steal
something from your mind.

1336
01:32:56,654 --> 01:33:00,240
I need you to focus and try
and remember what that is.

1337
01:33:00,407 --> 01:33:02,033
What is it, Mr. Fischer? Think!

1338
01:33:02,201 --> 01:33:05,954
A combination. They demanded
the first numbers to pop into my head.

1339
01:33:06,122 --> 01:33:08,832
They're trying to extract a number
from your subconscious.

1340
01:33:08,999 --> 01:33:12,794
It can represent anything.
We're in a hotel right now.

1341
01:33:13,587 --> 01:33:16,714
We should try hotel rooms.
What was the number, Mr. Fischer?

1342
01:33:16,882 --> 01:33:19,717
Try and remember for me.
This is very important.

1343
01:33:19,885 --> 01:33:21,219
Five.

1344
01:33:22,179 --> 01:33:24,639
Five, two... It was something,
it was a long number.

1345
01:33:24,807 --> 01:33:26,891
That's good. We can start there.
Fifth floor.

1346
01:33:27,059 --> 01:33:28,101
Yep.

1347
01:33:28,269 --> 01:33:32,313
- So do you use a timer?
- No, I have to judge it for myself.

1348
01:33:32,523 --> 01:33:35,775
While you're all asleep in 528,
I wait for Yusuf's kick.

1349
01:33:35,943 --> 01:33:38,069
- Well, how will you know?
- His music warns me.

1350
01:33:38,237 --> 01:33:42,198
And then when the van hits the barrier
of the bridge, that should be unmistakable.

1351
01:33:42,366 --> 01:33:45,535
So we get a nice synchronized kick.

1352
01:33:45,703 --> 01:33:48,121
If it's too soon,
we won't get pulled out.

1353
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:51,541
But if it's too late,
I won't be able to drop us.

1354
01:33:51,709 --> 01:33:55,545
- Well, why not?
- Because the van will be in freefall.

1355
01:33:56,046 --> 01:33:58,882
- Can't drop you without gravity.
- Right.

1356
01:34:04,555 --> 01:34:06,764
They're with me. Go on.

1357
01:34:31,081 --> 01:34:32,123
Mr. Charles.

1358
01:34:32,291 --> 01:34:35,251
- Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer?
- Yeah, I think so.

1359
01:34:35,419 --> 01:34:37,503
They were trying to put you under.

1360
01:34:37,922 --> 01:34:40,006
- I'm already under.
- Under again.

1361
01:34:40,174 --> 01:34:42,759
What do you mean,
a dream within a dream?

1362
01:34:43,344 --> 01:34:45,803
Hey. I see you've changed.

1363
01:34:45,971 --> 01:34:47,597
I'm sorry?

1364
01:34:48,098 --> 01:34:51,976
Oh, I'm sorry.
I mistook you for a friend.

1365
01:34:52,144 --> 01:34:53,436
Oh.

Good-looking fellow, I'm sure.

1367
01:34:56,398 --> 01:34:59,317
No, no, no. That's Fischer's
projection of Browning.

1368
01:34:59,485 --> 01:35:01,361
Let's follow him
and see how he behaves.

1369
01:35:01,528 --> 01:35:03,488
- Why?
- Because how he acts will tell us...

1370

...if Fischer is starting to suspect
his motives the way we want him to.

Well, not exactly. They already had him.
They were torturing him.

And you saw them torture him?

You're trying to get that safe open?
To get the alternate will?

to your father's last taunt.

- What taunt?
- The will, Robert. That will?

of his accomplishments.

1386
01:36:07,219 --> 01:36:12,598
- What, but that he was, um, disappointed?
- I'm sorry.

1387
01:36:13,976 --> 01:36:17,061
But he's wrong.

- Trust me, it's what I do.

He's hiding something,
and we need to find out what that is.

What is she talking about?

1642
02:03:03,959 --> 02:03:09,213
The reason I knew inception was possible
was because I did it to her first.

1643
02:03:10,257 --> 02:03:13,217
- I did it to my own wife.
- Why?

I knew we needed to escape,
but she wouldn't accept it.

1646
02:03:24,229 --> 02:03:29,901
She had locked something away,
something deep inside.

1647
02:03:30,652 --> 02:03:34,822
A truth that she had once known,
but chose to forget.

1648

And she couldn't break free.

1649
02:03:40,621 --> 02:03:43,331
So I decided to search for it.

1650
02:03:43,916 --> 02:03:48,795
I went deep into the recess of her mind
and found that secret place.

1651
02:03:48,962 --> 02:03:50,838
And I broke in...

1652

...and I planted an idea.

A simple little idea
that would change everything.

1654

That her world wasn't real.

1655
